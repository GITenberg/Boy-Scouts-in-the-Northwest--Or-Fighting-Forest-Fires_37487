<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—A MOUNTAIN MYSTERY.</h2>
<p>
On a sizzling hot afternoon near the middle
of August, in the year nineteen eleven, three
boys dressed in the khaki uniform of the Boy
Scouts of America stood on a lofty plateau near
the British frontier, watching with anxious eyes
the broken country to the south and west.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing stirring yet!” Jack Bosworth said,
turning to Pat Mack and Frank Shaw, his companions.
“Ned and Jimmie may be in trouble
somewhere. I wish we had waited and traveled
with them.”
</p>
<p>
“Traveled with them!” repeated Frank
Shaw. “We couldn’t travel with them. We
were fired—given the grand bounce—twenty-three
sign. Ned seemed to want the space in
the atmosphere we occupied at Missoula. Serve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
them good and right if they do get distributed
over the scenery.”
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind about Ned Nestor and
Jimmie McGraw,” Pat Mack put in. “They
can get along all right if someone isn’t leading
them by the hand. Suppose we fix up the camp
and get ready for our eats?”
</p>
<p>
The boys turned away from the lip of the
cañon upon which they had been standing and
busied themselves putting up shelter tents and
unpacking provisions and camping tools, as they
called their blankets and cooking vessels.
</p>
<p>
They had passed the previous night in a sheltered
valley lower down, sleeping on the ground,
under the stars, and had breakfasted from the
scanty stock of eatables carried in their haversacks.
Early that morning a train of burros had
landed their outfit at the end of a rough trail some
distance below, and the boys, with long labor and
patience, had carried it up to the plateau.
</p>
<p>
The men in charge of the burros had of course
volunteered to assist in the work of carrying the
goods to the place selected for the camp, but
their offers had been declined with thanks, for
the Boy Scouts were determined that for the
present no outsider should know the exact location
of their temporary mountain home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
Those who have read the previous books of
this series<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a> will not be at a loss to understand
why the location of the camp in the Northwest
was for a time to remain a secret, so far as possible.
Ned Nestor, for whom those on the plateau
were now waiting, had, some months before
that hot August afternoon, enlisted in the
Secret Service of the United States government.
</p>
<p>
Accompanied by Frank Shaw, Jack Bosworth,
Jimmie McGraw and others, he had seen
active diplomatic service during the Mexican
revolution, had unearthed a plot against the government
in the Panana Canal Zone, and had rendered
signal service in the Philippines, where
he had assisted in preventing an armed revolt
against the supremacy of the United States government.
</p>
<p>
At the close of his service in the Philippines,
he had been commissioned to investigate forest
fire conditions in the Great Northwest. The
boy had a wonderful native talent for detective
work, and, besides, it was thought by the officials
in charge of the matter that a party of Boy
Scouts, camping and roving about in northern
Idaho and Montana and in the southern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
sections of British Columbia, would be better able
to size up the forest fire situation than a party
of foresters or government secret service men.
</p>
<p>
So Ned and his four chums had sailed away
from Manila, reached San Francisco in due season,
and, after receiving further instructions and
arranging for supplies, had headed for the frontier.
At Missoula, Montana, he had sent Frank,
Jack and Pat on ahead, after giving them the
exact location of the future encampment and
arranging for the transportation of supplies.
</p>
<p>
From the first there had been some mystery in
the minds of the three concerning Ned’s strange
halt at Missoula. They could not understand
why he had sent them on ahead of him, for he
usually directed every detail of their journeyings.
When questioned concerning this innovation,
Ned had only laughed and told the boys to keep
out of the jaws of wild animals and not get lost.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be in camp almost as soon as you are,”
he had said, “and will take the first mountain
meal with you.”
</p>
<p>
Yet the boys had reached the vicinity of the
chosen location on the previous day, and Ned
had not made his appearance. Naturally the
boys were more than anxious about the safety
of their leader.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did Ned say anything to you while at Missoula,
about an aeroplane?” Jack asked of Frank
as they unpacked bacon and corn meal. “You
know, before we left the Philippines,” he went
on, slicing the bacon for the coming repast, “the
officials said we were to have a government aeroplane.
I was just wondering if the thing would
get here after we have no use for it.”
</p>
<p>
“He said nothing to me about the arrival of
the aeroplane,” Frank replied, “but I presume
he knows when the government air machine will
be on hand. It may be packed up at Missoula,
for all we know,” he added, “and Ned may have
waited there for the purpose of getting it ready
for flight.”
</p>
<p>
“What the dickens can we do with an aeroplane
in this wilderness?” demanded Pat, wiping
the sweat from his face. “We can’t run around
among the trees with it, can we? Nor yet we
can’t get gasoline up here to run it with. Anyway,
I’m no friend to these airships.”
</p>
<p>
“When they travel with upholstered dining
coaches in connection, and sleeping cars on behind,”
laughed Jack, “you’ll think they’re all
to the good. If we can’t chase around among
the trees in an aeroplane,” he continued, “we
can sail over the forests and high peaks, can’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
we? Without something of the sort, it would
take us about a thousand years to get a look-in
at this wild country.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Pat grumbled, “I only hope we
won’t get our necks broken falling out of the
contraption. It may be all right to go up in one
of the foolish things, but I think I’d rather take
chances on going over Niagara Falls in a rain-water
barrel.”
</p>
<p>
“I half believe he will come in the aeroplane,”
Frank said, shading his eyes with his hand and
looking out to the south. “He wants to surprise
us, I take it, and that is why he acted so
mysteriously about the matter.”
</p>
<p>
“What about Jimmie?” demanded Pat,
who would take almost any risk on water, but
who was filled with horror the moment his feet
left the solid earth. “He can’t bring Jimmie
along in his pocket, can he? And even if he
managed to get the little scamp up on the thing,
some trick would be turned that would land the
’plane on top of a high tree.”
</p>
<p>
“Two can ride an aeroplane, all right,”
Frank insisted. “Anyway, quit your knocking.
Ned knows what he is about, and we’ll wait here
for him if we have to remain until the Rocky
Mountains wash down into the Pacific Ocean.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we climb up on the shelf above,”
Jack suggested, “and see if we can find anything
in the sky that looks like an aeroplane. I really
think Ned and Jimmie will travel here on the
air line.”
</p>
<p>
Pat fished a field-glass out of his haversack
and passed it over to Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You boys go on up,” he said, “and see what
there is to be seen. I’ll stay here and cook this
bacon. I could eat a hog on foot right this minute.
Where did you put those canned beans?”
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind the canned beans,” laughed
Jack. “It will be time enough to open them
when you get the bacon fried to a crisp. I see
our finish if you got one of the bean cans opened.
Say, but I could eat a peak off the divide!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the divide is up there, all right,” Pat
grinned, “go on up and take a bite off it. On
this side that ridge away up there the rivers run
into the Pacific ocean. On the other side they
run into the Atlantic ocean. Split a drop when
you get on top and send your best wishes to
both oceans. And don’t you remain away too
long, either, for this bacon is going to be cooked
in record-breaking time.”
</p>
<p>
Leaving Pat to prepare the supper, Frank
and Jack turned their faces upward toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
main divide of the Rocky Mountains, 4,000 feet
above their heads. It was a splendid scene,
and they enjoyed it to the full. To the north
the green forests of British Columbia stood
crinkling under the almost direct rays of the
August sun, to the east, almost over their heads,
stood the backbone of the continent of North
America, to the south stretched the broken land
of Montana, while to the west lay the valleys
and ridges of Idaho, Montana, and Washington
beyond which pulsed the mighty swells of the
Pacific.
</p>
<p>
Immediately to the north of the position
occupied by the camp, and within a mile of
the international boundary line, Kintla lake
lay like a mirror in the lap of the mountains,
reflecting peaks and silent groves in its clear
waters. From the lake, ten miles in length by
half that in width, an outlet flowed westward
into the North Branch of the Flathead river.
</p>
<p>
The level plateau where the camp had been
pitched was not far from two acres in extent,
with the bulk of the mountain to the east, a drop
of a thousand feet to the south, and steep but
negotiable inclines to the west and north. The
lake was 300 feet below the level of the plateau,
which was about 3,000 feet above the sea level
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
and 4,000 feet below the summit of the divide
at that point in the long range of mountains.
</p>
<p>
There were peaks to the north and south
which showed eternal snow and ice, but there
was a lowering of the shoulder of the great chain
directly to the east, so there was no snow in sight
there. There were forest trees low down in the
cañon to the south, and on the slopes to the
west and north, but the plateau and the sharp
rise toward the summit were bare.
</p>
<p>
While Pat sliced his bacon and mixed corn-meal,
soda, salt and water to make hoecakes,
to be fried in bacon grease, Frank and Jack
wormed their way up the face of the mountain,
toward a shelf of rock some hundred feet above
the plateau. It was hard climbing, but the lads
persisted, and soon gained the elevation they
sought, from which it was hoped to gain a fine
view of the country toward Missoula.
</p>
<p>
“Good thing we don’t want to go any farther,”
Frank exclaimed, throwing himself down
on the ledge and wiping his streaming face.
“We couldn’t scale the wall ahead with a ladder.
Now,” he went on, “look out there to the south
and see if there’s an aeroplane in sight.”
</p>
<p>
Jack brought out the field-glass and looked
long and anxiously, but there was no sign of a
man-made bird in the clear sky.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe, after all, that he’ll come in
an aeroplane,” the boy said, directly. “Suppose
he took a notion to get a motor boat and
run up the north branch of the Flathead river,
and so on into Kintla lake, down there? How
long would it take him to make the trip?”
</p>
<p>
“About ten thousand years,” was Frank’s
reply. “He never could get up the north branch.
There’s too many waterfalls. Why, man, the
stream descends several thousand feet before it
gets to sea level.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Jack replied, “if you’ll get out
of my way I’ll take a look at the lake through
the glass.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll probably see him come sailing up
the slope in a battleship,” Frank said, in a sarcastic
tone.
</p>
<p>
Jack, without speaking, turned his glass to
the north and gazed long and anxiously over
the lake. Presently Frank saw him give a start
of surprise and lean forward, as if to get a closer
view of some object which had come into the
field of the lens.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Jack passed him the glass with no word of
explanation, and the boy hastily swept the
shores of the mountain lake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see any motor boat,” he said, directly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you see?” Jack asked, expectantly.
</p>
<p>
“For one thing,” Frank replied, “the smoke
of a campfire.”
</p>
<p>
“I saw that, too,” Jack said, “and didn’t
know what to make of it. Also, I saw a rowboat
sneaking around that green point to the east.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what is puzzling me,” Frank replied.
“Years ago there was a Blackfoot reservation
just over the divide, and a Flathead Indian
reservation down by Flathead lake, to the
south, but I had no idea the Indians were still
about. Still, the people you saw were probably
Indians. Suppose we go down there and look
the matter up. We’ve got to have some sort of
a yarn to tell Pat when we get back to camp.”
</p>
<p>
The two boys scrambled down almost vertical
surfaces, edged along narrow ledges, slid down
easier inclines, and finally came to the rim of
beach about the lake. There, at the eastern
end of the pretty body of water, they came upon
the still glowing embers of a fire.
</p>
<p>
Close to the spot where the remains of the
fire glimmered in the hot air, they saw the mouth
of a cavern which seemed to tunnel under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
body of the mountain to the east. There were
numerous tracks about the fire, and some of
them led to the entrance to the cavern.
</p>
<p>
“Whoever built this fire,” Jack exclaimed,
“wore big shoes, so it wasn’t Indians. No,
wait!” he added, in a moment, “there are tracks
here which show no heel marks. What do you
make of that?”
</p>
<p>
“Must be moccasins,” Frank said. “The
Indians may still be in the woods about here.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going into the cavern to see what’s
stirring there,” Jack said, “and before I go I’ll
have a look at my artillery.”
</p>
<p>
The boy looked his revolver over, and before
Frank could utter a warning, he darted away
into the gloom of the cave. Frank did not follow
him, but turned in the direction of the point
where the boat had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
A dozen yards on his way he stopped and
listened. A voice, sounding like that of a person
in a deep well, reached his ears, and he
turned back.
</p>
<p>
He gained the mouth of the cavern in half a
minute and plunged inside. It was dark a dozen
feet from the entrance, but he struck a match
and moved on, finally coming to a smooth wall
which appeared to shut off farther progress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
When he turned about and faced the opening
every object between where he stood and the
mouth stood revealed against the bright sunshine
outside. There were a few loose rocks, a
rude bench, a small goods box, and nothing else.
Jack was nowhere in eight.
</p>
<p>
He examined the walls of the cavern but discovered
no lateral passages. He called out to
his chum, but received no response. Where was
Jack? If he had left the cavern he would have
been seen. It was a perplexing mystery, and
the boy sat down on the box and listened for a
repetition of the sounds he had heard.
</p>
<p>
For a moment no sounds came, then a voice,
seemingly coming out of the solid wall behind
him reached his ears. He could distinguish no
words for a time, and then it seemed that he was
being called by name.
</p>
<p>
He called to Jack again and again, but received
no answer. Jack was evidently there
somewhere, but where? The smooth walls gave
no indication of any hidden openings, and there
was in view no crevice through which a voice
behind the walls might penetrate. It seemed
either a silly joke or an impenetrable mystery.

<p>
Frank left the cavern in a moment and
walked along the beach toward the campfire.
His thought was to gather embers and fresh fuel
and build up a blaze at the end of the cave which
would reveal every inch of the interior. He was
certain that Jack had not left the place, and decided
that he had fallen into some hidden opening
which had escaped his own investigation.
</p>
<p>
As he bent over the remains of the fire he
heard a rattle of small stones, and, looking up,
saw Pat coming down the declivity from the plateau
where the tents had been set up. The incline
was steep, and at times Pat was rolling
rather than walking. He was in his shirt sleeves
and bareheaded. At last his red head pitched
toward the lake like a meteor in downward flight.
</p>
<p>
Frank rushed forward and caught him as he
struck the beach, thus saving him from an impromptu
bath. Pat struggled to his feet in an
instant, rubbed his legs and arms to see if any
bones had been broken, and then turned his head
and looked up the incline.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“Talk about shooting the chutes!” he exclaimed.
“I wonder what time I made coming
down?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure you’re not hurt?” asked Frank anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Every inch of my body has three bruises,
one on top of the other,” Pat replied, “but I
guess I’m able to walk. Say, but that was a
roller-coaster glide!”
</p>
<p>
“Why did you try such a foolish caper?”
asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I saw you boys here,” was the reply,
“and started down. You know the rest, as the
yellow-covered books say. What you boys
doing here, wasting your time, with the bacon
burning to a crisp?”
</p>
<p>
“We came here to investigate,” was the reply,
“and Jack went into the cavern, and vanished—just
vapored into thin air. I’m going to
build a fire in there and see if I can’t condense
him!”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Pat said, listening, “he may have
vanished physically, but his voice appears to be
on deck yet.”
</p>
<p>
Three sharp calls came from the cavern, and
both boys dashed inside. There was no doubt
now that Jack’s voice, at least, had condensed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
for the shouts coming from the back of the cavern
were both hearty and imperative.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, there!” Jack called. “Pry this stone
out of the doorway!”
</p>
<p>
“Where are you?” demanded Pat. “Which
one of the walls do you want us to push in?
You’re a nice chump, getting in a scrape like
this!” he added, with a laugh which must have
been exasperating to the unseen boy.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find a crevice where the back of the
cave joins the south wall,” Jack said, his voice
coming faintly to the ears of his chums. “Put
your fingers in and pull. The blooming door
opens outward. Hurry! It’s stifling in here!”
</p>
<p>
After burning nearly all the matches they
had in their pockets, and scorching their fingers
on the short sticks, Pat and Frank discovered
the crevice spoken of and inserted the ends of
their fingers.
</p>
<p>
“Pull!” yelled Jack. “Pull, you loafers! It
is moving!”
</p>
<p>
In a moment the south half of the back wall
swung out so suddenly that both boys were
thrown from their feet and Jack, who had been
pushing with his whole strength, came tumbling
on top of them as they lay on the floor of the
cavern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“What sort of a combination is this, anyway?”
demanded Pat, struggling to his feet.
“If I get any more bumps to-day I’ll be taking
something that belongs to some one else. I’ve
had my share.”
</p>
<p>
Frank sprang to the opening as soon as he
could disentangle himself from the collection of
arms and legs and looked in. All was dark and
still inside, and a gust of dead air struck him in
the face. Pat, leaning over his shoulder, laid a
hand on the rock which had opened so strangely,
and the next instant it closed softly, sliding into
the opening like a door operated by well-oiled
machinery.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve done it!” Frank exclaimed,
disgustedly, as Pat threw himself against the
stone in a vain effort to force it open again.
</p>
<p>
“No harm done,” Jack exclaimed. “There’s
only a stinking cavern in there. Wow! I can
feel snakes and lizzards crawling on me now!
Come! Let us get into the open air. Stifles
like a grave in here.”
</p>
<p>
The boys hastened outside and stood meditatively
before the shining waters of the lake,
each one trying to think clearly concerning what
had taken place. They believed themselves—or
had believed, rather—miles away from any trace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
of civilization, and yet here was a practical door
of rock at the end of a cave almost under the
great divide.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve found something,” Frank said, at
length. “That thing in there never happened.
Human hands fashioned that door for some secret
purpose. And it wasn’t Indians, either.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we’ve run up against a band of train
robbers,” suggested Jack, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“Probably the entrance to some deserted
mine,” Pat put in. “This region has been
searched for gold for fifty years. I’ve heard of
mines being concealed by moving stones.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank said, after a short silence,
during which all listened for some indication of
the immediate presence of the men who had been
seen to row around the green point a short time
before, “whatever the game is, we’ve got to remove
every trace of our visit. When they come
back they probably won’t notice the tracks we
have made, for there were plenty about before
we came here, but we must gather up all the
match-ends we left in there and leave the door
as we found it.”
</p>
<p>
“I found it open and walked in,” Jack said,
“and then it closed. Whew! I felt like I was
being shut up in a tomb!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“How large a place is it in there?” asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know,” was the reply. “I had no
matches with me, and so could not see a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we won’t have to open the door again
to clean up any muss,” Frank said, moving toward
the entrance to the cavern.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t go in again for a thousand dollars,”
Jack cried. “If you leave it to me, the
place is haunted. I heard groans in there.”
</p>
<p>
Frank paused at the entrance and turned
back. His matches were about gone, and so
he took a burning stick from the fire, added two
dry faggots to it, waited until the three burst
into flame, and then entered the cave.
</p>
<p>
To gather up the half-burned matches which
had been scattered over the floor was the work
of only a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ll have to open the door, if you
leave it as I found it,” Jack said, looking in from
the mouth. “Pat will help you.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on in, both of you,” Frank directed.
</p>
<p>
“Not me!” cried Jack. “I hear bones rattling!”
</p>
<p>
The boys thought he was joking at first, but it
soon appeared that he was in sober earnest, so
Pat and Frank, by exerting their entire strength,
managed to open the door without his assistance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’re afraid of the dark!” Pat taunted,
as the boys gathered around the fire again.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not half as afraid of the dark as you are
of an aeroplane,” Jack replied. “If I ever see
you going up in a ’plane, I’ll go in there alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you ever forget that,” Pat grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll be game, all right,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Before leaving the beach for the camp the
boys walked to the point around which the boat
had gone and scanned the lake and its shores
through the field-glass. There was no sign of
life anywhere, except where the birds swung
from forest limbs back from the rim of the lake
and called each other through the sultry air.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the camp after a weary climb, they
did full justice to the meal which Pat had prepared,
though the bacon and the hoecakes were
stone cold, or at least as cold as anything could
be in that glare of sunlight. Then, the dishes
washed and the beds prepared for the night,
they sat down to watch the lake and the sky to
the south, for it was now the general belief that
Ned would make his appearance with the aeroplane
which had been promised by the government
officials.
</p>
<p>
The point they had last visited, as well as
the location of the fire, was in full view of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
plateau, so the boys made no efforts to conceal
their presence there. The men who had been
observed in the boat must have noted their
presence on the plateau before taking their leave.
Perhaps, they reasoned, they had taken their
departure because of this invasion.
</p>
<p>
The sun sank lower and lower in the sky,
turning the plateau and the smooth waters of the
lake to gold, still there were no signs of Ned, no
indications of the return of the boat to the place
from which it had been launched. Half an hour
after dark, Frank, who was looking through the
field-glass, caught sight of light in the south
which did not appear to come from any star.
</p>
<p>
“Here he comes!” he cried. “That’s an
aeroplane, all right!”
</p>
<p>
As the light drew nearer, traveling rapidly,
the sharp explosions of the gasoline engine became
audible. Then a light flickered over the
upper plane, passed off, and swept the white
surface again.
</p>
<p>
“How does he make that?” demanded Pat.
“Looks like a great question mark.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what it is,” Frank exclaimed.
“Now, what does he mean by it?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>Chapter III.—JUST A TYPEWRITER RIBBON.</h2>
<p>
“I don’t understand what question he is
asking,” Jack said, “but I know how he makes
the signal. He has an electric flashlight, and he
tips the plane—the upper plane—forward, like he
was plunging to the earth, and writes the interrogation
mark on the under side with the flame
of the flashlight. See? Then it shines through
the canvas and we read it! Great idea!”
</p>
<p>
“That must be the way of it,” Frank said,
“but what does he want? And how does he expect
us to answer?”
</p>
<p>
“If I was up there in the dark on a contraption
like that,” Pat said, “I’d be asking how I
was going to find a landing place.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” Frank cried. “Ned wants to know
where we are, and whether it is safe for him to
make a landing. Dunderheads! Why didn’t
we think of that before? He is passing now,
and may not come back again.”
</p>
<p>
The light flashed by at swift speed, whirled,
ascended several hundred feet, and came over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
plateau, repeating the signal. Then it settled
down into a steady circling of the camp.
</p>
<p>
“He knows where we are, all right,” Pat said.
“What he wants to know is if it is safe for him
to make a landing. If I ever go up in one of
those things I’ll drag a rope so I can climb down
it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell him what he wants to know,” Frank
said, “if you’ll get me a long stick on fire most of
its length.”
</p>
<p>
“Wigwag?” asked Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” was the reply. “Now,” Frank
continued, “build four fires, one on each edge of
the plateau. That will show him how large the
place is. Then I’ll take the flaming stick and
wigwag o.k. Ned’ll understand that.”
</p>
<p>
Pat watched the wigwag signal with interest.
</p>
<p>
“I saw foolish signs like those in the Philippines,”
he said, with a grin. “The natives use
them to talk treason to each other. I’ve heard
that the same method is used by the East Indians
who talk from one mountain top to another
faster than words on a wire. How does he make
the o.k. signal?”
</p>
<p>
“O is one left, followed by one right,” Jack
replied, “and k is left, right, left, right. You
won’t think the signs are foolish when you see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
how quickly Ned reads them. See! He’s
shooting away now.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he thinks the signals are being
made by savages,” Pat said.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane darted off to the west for half
a minute, then whirled and came back. The
boys could not see the great ’plane distinctly,
but the lights which burned on the front were
bright and clear, so they saw that the ’plane was
sweeping toward the earth as it advanced in
their direction.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe many professionals would
care to make a landing like this,” Frank said,
as the machine dipped and slid to the ground,
exactly in the center of the plateau.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Ned!” he yelled, as the aeroplane
rolled over the smooth surface for an instant and
stopped.
</p>
<p>
In a second the three boys were gathered
about the machine, pulling at the hands and feet
of the daring riders. Jimmie McGraw bounded
to the ground as soon as he could cast off the lines
which had held him to his quivering seat.
</p>
<p>
“Say,” he cried, “you got a fire here? I’m
most froze.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed the little fellow’s teeth were chattering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Cold?” echoed Pat. “We’re melting down
here. You’re scared, that’s what’s the matter
with you. You’re scared stiff.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie made a run for the speaker but
brought up at the fire where the supper had been
cooked.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s comfort!” he cried, extending his
hands out over what was left of the small blaze.
“The next time you get me up in the air I don’t
go! I’ve been freezing for an hour.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Ned Nestor was caring for
the aeroplane, looking after the delicate machinery
and covering it carefully with a huge oil-cloth.
Pat stood watching the work with a grin
on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Are you thinking of giving me a ride in that
thing?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not to-night!” laughed Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Well, when you get ready for me to ride the
air,” Pat said, “just tell me the night before, and
I’ll shoo myself into the hills. If I’m going to
fall off anything, I’ll take the drop from something
solid, like a mountain top.”
</p>
<p>
“No danger at all, when you know how to
operate the machine,” Ned replied. “There’s
danger in running anything if you don’t know
how, even a sewing machine.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where did you pick it up?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t pick it up at all,” interposed Pat.
“It picked him up.”
</p>
<p>
“I found it at Missoula,” was the reply, “all
packed and stored away in a freight warehouse.
I had to get it out at night, and so lost time.
The people would have kept me there until now
giving exhibitions if I had shown up during the
day.”
</p>
<p>
“But you did leave there in the daytime,”
urged Jack. “You were never in the air since
last night.”
</p>
<p>
“We left early this morning,” was the reply,
“and I was well up in the sky before many of the
people saw me.”
</p>
<p>
“I never knew you could run one,” Frank
said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I had some instructions from the
Wrights,” was the modest reply, “and, besides,
there was an expert at Missoula who helped me
get the machine together and contributed a few
parting instructions.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ve been in the air all day?”
asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
“No, we stopped several times, of course,
once on the right of way of the Great Northern
railroad and filled our gasoline tanks,” was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
reply, “and rested there a few hours. Jimmie
had to eat there, of course!”
</p>
<p>
“Eat!” came the boy’s voice from the fire.
“If I ever get a bite at food again it will drop
down into the toes of me shoes! Here!” he
shouted, as Pat produced a can of pork and beans
and started to open it. “You needn’t mind
opening that! I’ll just swallow it as it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Bright boy!” laughed Pat, handing him a
liberal supply of beans and fried bacon. “Now
fill up on that and then loosen up on your impressions
of the sky.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought I’d make an impression on the
earth before I got through,” Jimmie mumbled, his
mouth full of beans. “We went up so far that the
mountains looked like ant hills, didn’t we, Ned?”
</p>
<p>
“About 7,000 feet,” was the reply. “You
see,” he added, turning to Frank, “I wanted to
size up the situation before I landed. If there
is anybody in this upturned country at all, our
presence here is known. The aeroplane’s chatter
took good care of that. And, besides, our
landing in the night, with the lights going, gave
unmistakable evidence of something stirring.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so,” Frank agreed.
</p>
<p>
“And so,” Ned went on, “I wanted to learn
if there were people about here, so I might visit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
them in the morning and put up the bluff of
Boy Scouts playing with an aeroplane in the
woods. We can’t attempt anything in the mysterious
line,” he went on. “We’ve got to be
entirely frank about everything except the business
we are here on.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank said, “we found people here
to-day and called on them.”
</p>
<p>
“What sort of people?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, they seemed to have good broad
backs,” laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“They ran away from you?” asked Ned, in
surprise. “I should think they would have
proved inquisitive. Where were they?”
</p>
<p>
“Down by Kintla lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Indians?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
Then Frank told the story of the visit to
the shore of the lake and the cavern, taking
good care to describe the surroundings as closely
as possible. Ned laughed when the boy came
to Jack’s adventure in the hidden chamber.
</p>
<p>
“I say it is some deserted mine,” Pat declared,
when Frank had concluded the recital.
“What else could it be?”
</p>
<p>
“Robber’s nest!” suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>
Ned remained silent for a moment and then
abruptly asked:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“What kind of footwear made those heelless
prints?”
</p>
<p>
“You may search me!” Jack cut in.
</p>
<p>
“Must have been Indian moccasins,” Frank
observed.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie, who had been standing by the small
fire, listening to the talk, now advanced to the
little circle about the machine and uttered one
word: “Chinks!”
</p>
<p>
“It is always Chinks with Jimmie,” grinned
Frank. “When there is a cyclone in New York
the Chinks are to blame for it, if you leave it to
him.”
</p>
<p>
“What would Chinks be doing up here?”
demanded Pat.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t they get gold by washing it out?”
asked Jack, with a nudge at Jimmie’s side.
“Perhaps they’re going to start a laundry!”
</p>
<p>
While this chaff was in progress Ned stood
looking thoughtfully in the direction of the lake.
Not a word did he say regarding the sudden and
brief communication Jimmie had presented.
</p>
<p>
“Any forest fires in sight?” asked Pat, finally
breaking the silence.
</p>
<p>
“Not one,” Jimmie answered. “I would have
dropped into one if it had come my way. It
was fierce up there!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is rather cool when you get up a couple
of miles,” Ned laughed, “and Jimmie wouldn’t
listen to reason regarding his clothes. To-morrow
I’ll give one of you boys a ride, and you may
see for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Not me!” Pat exclaimed. “I’ll stay below
and help pick up the pieces.”
</p>
<p>
“I should like to go,” Frank said. “We
may find the people we saw in the rowboat.
When we become acquainted with them we may
be able to learn something about that cavern.”
</p>
<p>
“I would advise remaining silent about the
cavern,” Ned said. “It may be used for some
criminal purpose, and we must not admit that
we know of its existence. We are just carefree
lads, here for an outing, remember,” he added,
with a laugh, “and we are due to make friends
with everybody we come across.”
</p>
<p>
“But you made us lug all this camping outfit
up here,” complained Jack, “so the men who
steered the burros up the hills wouldn’t know
where we camped. What about that?”
</p>
<p>
“I thought it best to cut off all communication
with the people below,” explained Ned.
“It may be that the purpose of our visit here is
suspected. In that case some one from below
might want to find us—for no good purpose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
So we’ll keep out of sight of the people in the
towns, unless they see our aeroplane, and cultivate
the acquaintance of the natives—if there
are any.”
</p>
<p>
“How about gasoline and provisions?” asked
Pat.
</p>
<p>
“I have plenty of gasoline stored on the right
of way of the Great Northern railroad,” Ned
replied, “enough to last us a month. It was
piped into a hidden tank from an oil car by a
train crew now out of the state. We are to get
provisions at the same place, if we need more,
for Uncle Sam fixed all the details for us. All we
have to do is to find the fellows who are setting
forest fires and bring them to punishment.”
</p>
<p>
“We ought to locate every little smudge,
with that aeroplane,” Frank suggested.
</p>
<p>
“That is my idea,” Ned replied. “Have
you been keeping a good lookout on the lake
since you left it?” he added, turning to Pat.
</p>
<p>
“Some one of us has had eyes on it every
minute,” was the satisfactory reply. “No one
has returned, I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re not thinking of going there to-night,
are you?” asked Jack, with a slight shiver. “I
wouldn’t go in there again, even in broad daylight,
for a million dollars!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pat is afraid of the sky, and Jack is afraid
of the bowels of the earth!” laughed Frank.
“We’ll have to tuck them both in bed before we
can accomplish anything.”
</p>
<p>
“You may all go to bed but one,” Ned said,
looking about the group, his eyes finally resting
with a significant look on Frank’s excited face.
“I want to look through that cavern before anything
is taken out of it.”
</p>
<p>
Frank, knowing the meaning of the look he
had received, went to his little tent for his revolver
and his electric searchlight and was soon
ready for the expedition. Jimmie looked sulky
for a moment at being left out of the game, then
his face brightened and he crawled into the tent
that had been prepared for Nestor and himself
and burst into a fit of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll show ’em!” he said, stuffing the blanket
into his mouth to suppress the sound of his merriment.
“I’ll teach ’em to put me in the discard.”
</p>
<p>
“Any wild animals up here?” asked Ned, as
the two started away down the steep declivity.
</p>
<p>
“Two Black Bears and three Wolves!” called
Jimmie, from his tent.
</p>
<p>
This was a reference to the Boy Scout Patrols
to which the boys belonged. Frank and Jack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
were members of the famous Black Bear Patrol
of New York City, while Ned, Pat and Jimmie
were members of the Wolf Patrol.
</p>
<p>
As the lad spoke Frank and Jack broke into
growls which might well have come from the
throat of the grizzliest grizzly in the Rocky
Mountains, while Pat sent forth a wolf howl,
which might well have been a signal to the pack.
</p>
<p>
“You may meet the real thing out here,”
warned Ned, turning back to look over the plateau,
now shining in the light of a half-moon.
“There are both bears and wolves in this region.
When you meet them, don’t wait for Boy Scout
signs!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll initiate ’em, all right,” Jimmie
called from the tent, and Ned and Frank moved
on down the declivity toward the lake.
</p>
<p>
It was still early evening, and the moon was
low down in the east, so the valley where the
lake lay was not touched by its light. Indeed,
the plateau where the boys were would have
been in the shadow of the mountain only for the
dropping of the shoulder of the divide.
</p>
<p>
In half an hour the two boys, after several
slides which were anything but pleasant, gained
the beach. The campfire was now dead, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
the locality was still save for the voice of a night
bird and the occasional splash of a leaping fish.
The mouth of the cavern loomed like a dark
patch on the lower bulk of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
Making as little noise as possible, Ned and
Frank crept into the cavern, advancing by the
sense of feeling until they came to the very end
before turning on one of the electric flashlights.
The round eye of the flame showed a long, narrow,
tunnel-like tube running directly east, under
the mountain. The door of rock was as the boys
had left it earlier in the day.
</p>
<p>
Ned examined that portion of the rock which
had swung out into the first chamber with considerable
care, as the story of the swinging stone
had interested him greatly. All along the top,
up to the center, he found the checks of a stone-chisel.
Exactly in the middle an elevation of an
inch fitted into a round cavity in the upper rock.
At the bottom the same conditions were discovered.
</p>
<p>
“Rather a clever job,” Ned said, “but I
don’t see how it was ever done.”
</p>
<p>
“This door,” Frank said, “is not exactly like
the remainder of the wall in grain, so it must
have been brought here from some other locality.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
Of course there was a hole between these two
chambers, or the second one would never have
been found. It would be easy enough to fit the
stone door in by grooving out from the lower
cavity and sliding the under pivot in.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” Ned replied, getting down to examine
the lower part of the door more closely,
“and that is just what was done. Then the
groove was filled with concrete. Pretty classy
work here!”
</p>
<p>
“And now the question is this,” Frank went
on, “what was the door fitted for? Why did
the men who found the cave desire privacy? Is
there gold in there? Have the men who have
been setting fire to the forests established a home
here? Is this the hiding place of a band of outlaws?
You see there are lots of questions to ask
about the two caverns,” Frank added, with an
uneasy laugh.
</p>
<p>
Ned closed the stone door and turned on
both electric flashlights, making the place light
as day where they stood. The inner cavern was
as bare as the outer one save for dead leaves and
grass which lay in heaps on the stone floor, and
for half a dozen rough benches which were piled
in one corner. At the farther end hung a gaudy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
curtain, once handsome, but now sadly spotted
with mildew because of dampness.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s the inner chamber,” laughed Frank,
drawing the curtain aside. “And it looks like
it was the private office of the bunch, too,” he
added, as he turned the light about the walls.
</p>
<p>
There was a desk in the third cavern, a swivel
chair, a small case of books, and a rusty safe,
which looked as though it had not been opened
for years. A current of fresh air came from the
rear, and a small opening was soon discovered.
</p>
<p>
“That doubtless leads to some cañon not far
away,” Ned said. “Makes a pretty decent
place of it, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Good enough for any person to hide in,”
replied Frank. “Now,” he added, “tell me
what you think of it. Who cut this cavern, and
who brought the furniture here? I’ll admit that
my thinker is not working.”
</p>
<p>
“Nature made the caverns,” Ned replied.
“There is what geologists call a fault in the rock
here. Owing to volcanic action, doubtless, the
strata shifted, probably thousands of years ago,
and when the seam appeared the broken pieces
fell apart. These chambers show the width of
the seam. There undoubtedly was a great earthquake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
at the time, and the lake below might
have been dredged out at that time.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” Frank said, “I might have
known that! Now, here’s another question:
How far does this seam extend under the Rocky
Mountains? If it passes beyond these three
chambers, why not make a fourth room for ourselves
so as to be on the spot when the men who
make headquarters of the place come back?”
</p>
<p>
“That may be a good thing to do,” Ned admitted,
“but, still, I would not like to be the
one to lie in wait here. Suppose we try to learn
something of the character of the people who
come here? They seem to sleep on dry leaves
and eat off benches. Rather tough bunch, I
take it. Perhaps we have struck Uncle Sam’s
enemies the first thing!”
</p>
<p>
Keeping their lights on, and working as silently
as possible, always with an eye to the outer
cavern, the boys made a careful search of the
inner chamber. The desk was not fastened, and
a cupboard afterward discovered in a niche was
open also. There were dishes in the cupboard
and writing materials in the desk.
</p>
<p>
At the very bottom of the desk drawer Ned
came upon a surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not so tough as I supposed,” he said, turning
to Frank. “Here’s a typewriter ribbon.
The sort of people who set fire to forests and hold
up trains are hardly in the typewriter class.
What do you make of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank said, with a chuckle, “if
you’ll tell me what the inhabitants of this place
want of typewriter ribbons I’ll tell you why they
bring great tins of opium here. It seems that
we have struck something more important than
forest fires.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—THE AEROPLANE IN DANGER.</h2>
<p>
A strong wind came out of the Western Sea
at ten o’clock that night and swept the lofty
plateau as a woman might have swept it with
a new broom. Ned and Frank, pursuing their
investigations in the cavern, knew nothing of
what was going on at the camp, but Jack and
Pat were not long in ignorance of the danger of
the situation.
</p>
<p>
With the first strong rush of wind the boys
were on their feet, steadying the aeroplane, driving
stakes wherever the nature of the ground
permitted, and running bracing cords. The
shelter tents went down instantly and were
blown against the rocks of the east, where they
waved canvas arms in the tearing breeze like
sheeted ghosts.
</p>
<p>
The black clouds which swarmed up from the
valley brought no rain, but fitful flashes of lightning
and deep-toned thunder made a threatening
sky. The roaring of the swirling trees in the
cañon and on the slopes came up to the ears of
the boys like the boom of a strong surf.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
After persistent efforts the boys succeeded in
bracing the aeroplane so that there was little
danger of its being swept away, though they
still remained with their backs to the wind, holding
on. As time passed, they crept close together
in order that the situation might be discussed.
</p>
<p>
“Lucky thing we remained here,” Pat said,
tugging with all his might to steady the monster
machine against a particularly vicious dash of
wind.
</p>
<p>
“It would have gone sure, if we hadn’t,”
Jack screamed back. “I wish Ned and Frank
would come and help. My back is creaking like
a shaft that needs oiling with the strain on it.”
</p>
<p>
“A little help wouldn’t go amiss,” Pat admitted,
shouting at the top of his lungs in order
that he might be heard above the whistling of
the storm.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if we’ll ever be able to put the
tents up again?” Jack shouted. “They are flapping
and snapping like musketry out there on the
rocks. I hope they won’t blow away entirely.”
</p>
<p>
Pat gazed anxiously in the direction indicated,
but could only see pieces of canvas bellying
up in the wind, mounting upward like balloons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
at times, then falling back to earth when a short
lull came in the storm.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” he cried, in a moment, “where’s
Jimmie? I thought I saw him here a moment
ago. Have you seen him?”
</p>
<p>
“Not since the storm,” panted Jack.
</p>
<p>
“He may have been smothered in his tent,”
Pat shouted. “You hold on here while I go and
look him up.”
</p>
<p>
“Be sure that you keep close to the ground,”
warned Jack. “If you don’t you’ll be blown
away.”
</p>
<p>
It was not at all difficult for the lad to reach
the flapping tents, for the wind generously assisted
him in the journey. Only that he crept on
his hands and knees he would have been tossed
against the wall where the tents lay.
</p>
<p>
Struggling with the tearing canvas, bracing
himself against the face of the cliff, the boy
looked over the ruined tents but found no indication
of the presence of the boy he sought, either
dead or alive. Then he felt along the angle of
the foot of the rise with no better success.
</p>
<p>
“He’s not there,” he reported, crawling back
to Jack, now braced tenaciously with his toes
and elbows digging into the soil above the rock.
</p>
<p>
“Did you find his clothes?” asked Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing belonging to his outfit,” was
the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Well, he went to bed, didn’t he?” asked
Jack, a sudden suspicion entering his mind.
</p>
<p>
“He went into his tent,” was the reply,
“but I did not see him undress.”
</p>
<p>
Then Pat, much to his astonishment, heard
Jack laughing as if mightily pleased over something
that had taken place.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got your nerve!” he exclaimed.
“Laughing at a time like this. I’ll bet the kid
has been blown off the plateau.”
</p>
<p>
There was now a little lull in the drive of the
wind and Jack nudged his companion with his
elbow, turning an amused face as he did so.
</p>
<p>
“Blown off nothing!” he said. “You saw
how he acted when Ned went off without him—how
sulky he was?”
</p>
<p>
“I noticed something of the sort.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Jimmie ducked after him!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he was told to remain here.”
</p>
<p>
“He has been told that before,” Jack said,
“and he’s never obeyed orders. He followed
Ned from Manila to Yokohama, not long ago,
and made a hit in doing it, too. Oh, it is a sure
thing that Jimmie is not far from Ned at this
minute.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“The little scamp!” grinned Pat.
</p>
<p>
“He seems to think that Ned can’t get along
without his constant presence and his pranks,”
Jack continued. “He generally stirs something
up in his immediate vicinity, but he’s a pretty
good scout at that.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope he is with Ned,” Pat said.
</p>
<p>
The wind now died down a bit, so that it was
no longer necessary to hold the aeroplane, and
the boys, after seeing that the rope still held,
began the work of repairing the tents.
</p>
<p>
The clouds drifted away and the moon looked
down as bravely as if it had not just hidden its
face from sight at the threats of the wind! The
electric flashlights with which the boys were
well provided seemed inadequate and Pat started
in to build a fire.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that,” Jack said. “If
there had been a fire here when that wind came
up it would have been roaring in the cañon now.
The storm would have swept it down on the
trees there, and the whole gully would soon have
become a roaring furnace. Better cut out the
fire.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you are right,” Pat said, reluctantly
laying his dry faggots aside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
While the boys worked, trying to restore the
shelter tents to something like form, the wind
came up once more and reached out for the aeroplane.
Pat and Jack renewed their holding
efforts, and thanked their stars that no fire had
been built on the plateau, for the forest about
was dry as tinder.
</p>
<p>
Presently a voice which neither recognized
came out of the shadows cast by a mass of clouds
just then occupying the sky where the moon
should have been.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” the voice said.
</p>
<p>
The boys looked at each other in perplexity
for a moment and then Jack answered back.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Are you all safe up here, safe and sound?”
the voice asked, and then the figure of a tall
man, roughly dressed, but bearing the manner, as
faintly observed in the darkness, of a gentleman,
advanced toward the aeroplane, to which the
lads were still devoting their whole attention.
</p>
<p>
“Safe and sound!” repeated Pat.
</p>
<p>
The stranger sat down by Jack’s side and
laid hold of the aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
“Pulls hard, doesn’t it?” he asked, as the
machine, forced by the wind, drew stoutly on
the ropes and the muscles of the boys.

<p>
“Pulls like a horse,” Jack replied.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Greer, of the forest service,” the
stranger said, in a moment. “I saw a fire up
here this afternoon, and I was afraid harm might
come from it during the gale. One blazing
brand down in that cañon, and millions of feet
of timber would be destroyed.”
</p>
<p>
“As you see,” Jack said, “we have no fire.”
</p>
<p>
“This, I presume,” Greer said, still pulling
at the machine, “is the aeroplane your friends
came in this evening?”
</p>
<p>
“The same,” replied Pat shortly.
</p>
<p>
The lad was annoyed to think that the forester,
as he called himself, had been watching
them. If he had taken so much interest in their
movements, Pat thought, why hadn’t he shown
himself before?
</p>
<p>
Jack’s thoughts seemed to be running in the
same direction. In fact, both boys were suspicious
of this soft-spoken stranger who had
come to them out of the storm with questions
on his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Where are your friends?” Greer asked, in a
moment. “I hope they are not out in the forest
thinking of starting a fire?”
</p>
<p>
“They’ve gone to the lake after fish,” Jack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
said, accounting for the absence of the others
with the first words that came to his lips.
</p>
<p>
Greer gave a quick start and leaned over to
look into Jack’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Down at the lake?” he repeated. “Not
out in a boat in a storm like this?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied Jack, gruffly, so gruffly, in
fact, that the stranger caught the hostile note
and turned away.
</p>
<p>
“I’m always afraid of fire on a night like this,”
Greer continued in a moment, “and rarely sleep
until morning. My cabin is back on the mountain
a short distance, some distance above this
plateau. That’s how I happened to see what
was going on here.”
</p>
<p>
“Rather a lonely life,” Pat said, resolved to
keep the fellow talking if he could. “Because,”
he reasoned, “you can tell what’s in a man’s
head if he keeps his mouth open and his tongue
moving, but no one can tell the secret locked up
behind closed lips.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is rather lonely,” Greer replied.
“I’m glad you boys are here. Going to remain
long?”
</p>
<p>
“Only a few weeks—just to hunt and fish,”
was Jack’s reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t mind,” Greer went on, “I’ll
come down and visit you now and then.”
</p>
<p>
The statement almost took the form of a
question, and Jack gave a grudging answer that
the visits would be a pleasure, though he believed
that the man was arranging a way of watching
their movements.
</p>
<p>
“I wish this wind would go down,” Greer
said, presently. “As I said before, I’m always
afraid of fire on nights like this. See! The
wind blows straight off the distant ocean strong
and steady, and a fire started out there to the
west would run over this plateau and over the
mountain like a wash of tide.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s nothing to burn on the plateau,”
Jack said, glad of an opportunity to contradict
the stranger.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing to burn!” Greer repeated. “I
reckon you don’t know much about forest fires,
young man! Why, it would burn the soil down
to bed rock, even evaporate the water in the
rock itself and crumble it down to ashes. A
forest fire is no joking matter.”
</p>
<p>
The boys remained silent, looking cautiously
into each other’s faces and both wondering how
a forester, a man marooned in a great wilderness
should be so exact in his speech, should wear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
such a shirt—actually a dress shirt—as they
saw under his rough coat when the wind blew it
aside.
</p>
<p>
“I rather think there’s more company coming,”
Greer continued, seeing that the boys
were not inclined to comment on his warnings.
“A moment ago I saw a flash of light at the foot
of the rise to the west.”
</p>
<p>
The wind was still blowing fiercely, but both
boys turned and looked down the incline. There
was a faint light there now, glimmering among
the trees.
</p>
<p>
“It looks like a lantern,” Greer said. “And
the fellow seems about to climb the hill. Good
luck to him, in this gale.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me,” Pat said, “that the light
we see is running along on the ground. If that
should be a forest fire, there would be the dickens
to pay to-night—and nothing to pay with!”
</p>
<p>
“That is not the way forest fires start,”
Greer said, turning indolently in the direction
of the divide. “That is a man with a lantern.”
</p>
<p>
The boys watched the glimmer below with
interest. The man with the lantern, if there
was a man and a lantern, seemed to be moving
with the wind. Then, again, he seemed to divide
himself, as the lower orders of life at the bottom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
of the seas divide themselves, appearing on both
sides of a dark space at the same moment.
</p>
<p>
They were satisfied that something unusual
was going on, but were for the moment lulled
into a half-sense of security by the positive assertions
of the alleged forester. Presently they
turned away from the scene below and fixed
their eyes on the stranger.
</p>
<p>
He was standing straight up, his tall figure
braced against the wind, peering down into the
cañon. Notwithstanding the steady wind, the
sky was now comparatively free of clouds, and
they saw him lift a hand with something bright
shining in it.
</p>
<p>
It appeared to the lads that he was signaling
to some one in the cañon. They turned away
instantly so that Greer did not note their observation
of him, and again fixed their gaze
on the slope to the west.
</p>
<p>
The lantern, if there was a lantern, was growing
larger! It was showing itself in half a dozen
places now, and was tracing lights far up in the
crotches of dead trees. Then the penetrating
odor of burning wood and grass came up the
slope.
</p>
<p>
Filled with a fear which could hardly be
expressed in words, the boys faced Greer again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
He still stood facing the cañon to the south, but
his hands were not lifted now. There was no
need for that, the boys thought, for the previous
signal seemed to have sufficed.
</p>
<p>
Among the dry faggots on the ground at the
bottom of the cañon there was another man with
a lantern. He, too, if there was such a man, was
moving about among the trees and dividing himself
into sections, as the rudimental creatures of
the world multiply themselves. Pat sprang to
Greer’s side and shook him roughly by the arm.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a fire down there!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
In the uncertain moonlight the boy saw the
stranger’s face harden.
</p>
<p>
“You are mistaken,” he said, turning away
toward the lake.
</p>
<p>
“Smell the smoke!” Jack shouted. “I tell
you the forest is on fire on two sides of us.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your friends have set the fires!”
Greer shouted, against the wind. “I have been
suspicious of you all along—ever since you failed
to satisfactorily account for the absence of your
friends. It is all very well for you to come here
in an aeroplane and start a conflagration! But
how do you think that we, who are not so well
provided with means of getting away, are to
escape death?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
Pat drew back his hand, as if to strike the
fellow, but Jack restrained him.
</p>
<p>
“You set the fires!” Pat shouted, then.
“You set it through your fellow conspirators!
I saw you signaling to the cañon!”
</p>
<p>
“You’re no more a forester than I am!” Jack
added. “You’re a scoundrel, and ought to be
sent to prison for life.”
</p>
<p>
There was no more talk for a time. Greer
stood defiantly against the wall of rock to the
east, as if fearful of an attack from behind, his
right hand in his bulging pocket. The boys
knew that he had a weapon there, and their own
hands were not empty.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane drew and shivered in the rising
gale, but now little attention was paid to it.
Pat and Jack were listening for some indication
of the return of Ned and Frank. No farther
fable of a man with a lantern was necessary, for
fire was racing up the western slope, heading
directly for the plateau and the priceless aeroplane.
Down in the cañon the flames were
leaping from tree to tree. A stifling smoke filled
the air, always in swift motion, but stifling still.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—THE REVELATION OF A TRAGEDY.</h2>
<p>
“Smugglers!” Frank exclaimed, dropping an
armful of unopened opium tins on the floor of
the cavern. “Smugglers, all right, all right!”
</p>
<p>
Ned looked the tins over carefully. They
were well covered with Chinese characters, and
were dirty, as if they had been hidden away in
the earth for a long time.
</p>
<p>
“Who would have suspected it?” Frank continued.
“We are close to the British frontier,
but, all the same, this seems to me to be an awkward
place to land and store the dope stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did you find it?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“There is a false back to that cupboard in
the north wall,” Frank replied. “When I
knocked on the boards they gave forth a hollow
sound, and so I tore one away. Hence the
opium. And there are pipes there, too—just
such pipes as one sees in the joints on Pell
street, in little old New York.”
</p>
<p>
“You remember what Jimmie said?” asked
Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“I remember a good many things the little
rascal has said,” was the laughing reply. “He’s
always saying something.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Ned continued, “the boy was right
when he expressed his opinion of the heelless
footprints in one word.”
</p>
<p>
“Chinks!” grinned Frank. “Of course!”
</p>
<p>
The boys now went over to the cupboard in
the niche and began tearing away the boards.
After a few had been displaced Ned stopped and
began experimenting in fitting them in position
again.
</p>
<p>
“What’s doing now?” demanded Frank.
</p>
<p>
“We must remove them so as to be able to
return them as we found them before we leave,”
Ned replied. “It is important that the inhabitants
of this robber den do not know that we
have discovered it.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you ever think they don’t know it
right now,” Frank said. “We haven’t seen any
of them since they rowed around the point, but
they’re stirring about, just the same. We may
see more of them before we get out of this cavern.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Ned said, “we must take all the
precautions needful, and if they are of no avail
we shall not be to blame for what takes place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
Even if they know that we have found the cavern,
they need not know that we have penetrated
into the office chamber. Now, draw that last
board away carefully, and we’ll see what there
is behind the false bottom.”
</p>
<p>
Frank drew the board away and was confronted
by a long, low tunnel—an uncanny, narrow
tunnel which had evidently been enlarged
from a fault in the rock, and which appeared to
penetrate far into the bulk of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
“See!” he cried. “The cupboard was built
at the mouth of a cross fault in the rock, and
there is no knowing what is behind it. Hold
your flashlight higher and I’ll crawl in and
look about.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful,” Ned warned. “I have seen
great holes at the bottom of tunnels like that.
Don’t break your neck, or tumble down so far
that I can’t fish you out.”
</p>
<p>
Frank grinned and crept through the opening
made by the removal of the back of the closet.
The place was not high enough for him to stand
upright, and so he proceeded on hands and knees.
</p>
<p>
“This is a bedroom,” he shouted back to
Ned. “There’s lots of ticks and blankets here.”
</p>
<p>
There was silence for a moment, and then the
boy’s voice came from farther in the tunnel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
“And here’s kegs of whisky,” he cried. “It
smells like a Bowery saloon. Come on in!”
</p>
<p>
“I think one of us would better remain outside,”
Ned replied. “I wouldn’t like to be surprised
while in there and fastened in with rocks.”
</p>
<p>
Frank went on down the tunnel for some distance,
calling back, now and then, to report his
discoveries. There were weapons stored there,
barrels of gasoline, packages of dynamite.
</p>
<p>
Then, for several long minutes, there came
no voice from the interior, and Ned put his head
inside and called out softly:
</p>
<p>
“Frank!”
</p>
<p>
There was no reply, and Ned was about to
advance into the opening when the sound of a
footstep came on the rocky floor of the chamber
just behind him. The footstep was a stealthy
one, halting, as if some person were listening between
the steps. Ned’s first act was to shut the
light off from his electric candle.
</p>
<p>
Then he moved away from the niche in the
wall where the cupboard had been built in and
waited. His greatest fear was that Frank would
turn about and show his light, and so expose
them both to danger. While he listened, almost
holding his breath, the steps came nearer to the
cupboard and halted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
But the halt was only for an instant, for the
unseen figure moved on again, this time back
toward the entrance. Directly the footsteps
were heard no more, and then the crash of falling
rocks reached the boy’s ears. He did not have
to think long in order to understand what that
sound portended.
</p>
<p>
He knew that they had been observed by
some of the outlaws who made the cavern their
home and their storehouse as well, had been followed
into the inner chamber, and were now to
be fastened into the cavern, probably left there
to starve, with tons of rock bulking before the
entrance to the third chamber. It was not a
pleasant situation.
</p>
<p>
While he studied the peril over in as optimistic
a mood as was possible under the circumstances,
he heard Frank calling to him from the
narrow tunnel behind the cupboard. The boy
was evidently excited, for his voice rang high.
</p>
<p>
“Ned!” he cried. “Come on in!”
</p>
<p>
The noise of falling, rolling rocks stopped at
the sound of Frank’s voice, and Ned thought he
heard a half-suppressed chuckle in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry!” came Frank’s voice once more.
“There’s something in here that takes the nerve
out of me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a low exclamation of rage at the
entrance, where the stones were piling up, and
then the grind of falling rocks was continued.
Ned had, of course, no idea as to how many persons
were engaged in building up the wall which
threatened to shut him in until life was extinct,
or exactly how it was being done, but he knew
that the correct thing for him to do was to prevent
the completion of the work.
</p>
<p>
If only one man had arrived at the cavern he
might be frightened and driven away by a little
shooting. With bullets whizzing through what
was left of the opening, the man who was building
the crude wall would not be likely to present his
body before the space still uncovered. This
reasoning brought the boy to a consideration of
the matter of ammunition, but he decided that,
with the cartridges carried by Frank, they could
defend the place for a long time.
</p>
<p>
But another question intervened. The rocks
which, though unseen, he knew to be blocking the
space where the rug had hung were undoubtedly
falling from a distance. They might have been
stored above the natural doorway for the very
purpose to which they were now being put.
</p>
<p>
If this were true, then the building of the
trap would continue, regardless of his bullets.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
While he studied over this problem, slowly making
up his mind to put it to the test, Frank’s
voice came from the tunnel again.
</p>
<p>
“What’s doing out there?” the boy asked.
“Why don’t you come in here?”
</p>
<p>
“Shut off your light!” ordered Ned, as a
glimmer showed inside.
</p>
<p>
“Not me,” replied Frank. “I need all the
light I can get in here!”
</p>
<p>
“What have you found?” asked Ned anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Frank did not reply instantly, and Ned
heard the rattle of stones while he waited for
his answer. The task of piling up the wall was
progressing rapidly, and it seemed to the boy
that the stones were all falling from a distance.
</p>
<p>
“Shut off your light and come out,” Ned said,
impatient at the hesitation.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t stay here in the dark for a thousand
dollars a second,” Frank replied, “but I’ll
come out. Why don’t you show a light?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not looking for any chance bullets,” Ned
replied, coolly. “We’re caught, my boy, and
it is up to us to move cautiously. Why don’t
you turn off your light?” he added, half angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” Frank replied, “you’re getting it out
there, too, are you? Well, I was trying to save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
you a shock. There’s a dead man in here, and
I’m going to keep my light going until I’m out
of the hole. I did shut it off once, and felt the
grasp of a hand on my neck—and there wasn’t
any hand there either.”
</p>
<p>
“A dead man?” repeated Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” Frank replied. “And he’s not been
dead very long, at that.”
</p>
<p>
Again the boy heard that vicious chuckle at
the entrance. Then a voice came out of the
mouldy darkness:
</p>
<p>
“How are you getting on in the Secret Service,
Ned Nestor?” the voice asked.
</p>
<p>
“Finely!” Ned called back, but it seemed to
him that his voice shook with the peril of the
situation. He was known, his mission there
was no secret, the enemies of the government
were already on the ground, ready to combat
him in his work. Just how far their hostility
would extend was evidenced by the fall of rocks
outside. It seemed to the boy that the struggle
would be to the death.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you talking to?” Frank asked.
</p>
<p>
Ned did not reply to the question, for there
came the sound of a scuffle outside, then a shot,
a cry of pain, and the cavern was still as a grave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
In the silence Frank’s movements were
heard, and Ned knew that he was backing out
of the tunnel, with his light still burning. Entirely
at a loss to account for the fracas outside,
Ned awaited his approach with a fast-beating
heart. When at last he shut off his electric
searchlight and dropped from the tunnel through
the old cupboard Ned seized his hand and drew
him away.
</p>
<p>
“Did you fire that shot?” Frank whispered.
</p>
<p>
“No,” was the reply. “There’s fighting
outside, and the shot was fired there. Now, I
had a notion of sending a stream of bullets
through the doorway, but the persons who are
fighting the man who came upon us here may
be our friends, so we must be careful what we do.
Here. Take my flashlight. Open the two at
the same instant and turn the rays on the doorway.
I’ll be ready with my gun.”
</p>
<p>
But before this movement could be carried
out a voice the boys knew came out of the darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder you wouldn’t give a fellow a lift,”
Jimmie said, in a panting tone. “I’ve got to
the limit with this big stiff.”
</p>
<p>
The lights were on instantly, with Ned and
Frank bounding toward the opening. The way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
was narrow, for many rocks had been dropped
down from a broad ledge just above, but they
managed to crawl through. But before Ned
could reach the struggling pair on the floor the
under figure wiggled away, staggered for an
instant, and then made for the outer air at good
speed.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie sat upon the stone floor with a disgusted
look on his freckled face.
</p>
<p>
“Now see what you’ve been an’ gone an’
done!” he cried. “You’ve let me pirate get
away! But he took a bullet with him,” he
added.
</p>
<p>
“How many were here?” asked Ned, shutting
off his light and telling Frank to do the
same. “How many men did you see?”
</p>
<p>
“Just that one,” Jimmie replied, sorrowfully,
“an’ he got away!”
</p>
<p>
Ned advanced to the entrance and listened.
At first he heard the sound of limping footsteps,
then the sweep of oars. He ran down to the
beach and swept his light over the waters of the
lake. A slender boat was speeding far to the
north, and a solitary rower was bending to his
work.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the first time, Ned noted that a
fierce gale was blowing from the west, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
thoughts went back to the plateau where the
aeroplane lay exposed to the storm. He ran
back to the cavern, barely escaping being blown
off his feet on the way, and called to the boys.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a stiff wind blowing,” he said, “and
I’m afraid for the aeroplane. We must get back
to the camp immediately.”
</p>
<p>
“The wind was on when I came in,” Jimmie
said, “an’ it near blew me into the lake, even
if I did hold on to the trees. We can never
make the hill in the storm.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to,” Ned insisted.
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” Jimmie continued, “we want to
find out about the dead man Frank has been
telling me about. We can’t take him with us,
an’ he will not be here when we come back.
Whatever we learn about him, an’ the cause of
his death, must be learned now.”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes, Jimmie,” Frank burst out,
“you exhibit signs of almost human intelligence!”
</p>
<p>
“The boy is right,” Ned observed. “I’m
so rattled that I hardly know what I’m about.
We ought to be in pursuit of that rascal who is
rowing on the lake, we ought to be on the plateau,
looking after the aeroplane, and we ought
to be here, finding out if a murder has been committed.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is a murder, all right,” Frank said, “for
the floor in the tunnel is sticky with blood.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m goin’ in there!” Jimmie exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Go if you want to,” Frank grunted.
</p>
<p>
Ned laid a hand on Jimmie’s arm as he started
away.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t mind,” he said, “I’d much
rather you remained on guard. You have keen
eyes, and may be of great service here.”
</p>
<p>
“All right!” the boy said. “I’ll do anything
you ask me to if you don’t leave me out of the
game.”
</p>
<p>
“No danger of your getting into the dust
heap,” Frank laughed. “How long have you
been prowling about here?”
</p>
<p>
“Just a short time,” was the reply. “I remained
in the tent until I thought Pat an’ Jack
were asleep an’ then cut my lucky. Say, but
the wind was blowin’ when I slid down the slope
toward the lake.”
</p>
<p>
“It must be fierce up on the plateau,” Frank
admitted. “Say,” he added, turning to Ned,
“if you don’t mind, I’ll go on up the hill and help
the boys with the aeroplane. It would be a
tragedy if it should be destroyed now.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Ned said. “Get up there as
soon as possible. The boys may be having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
trouble with the ’plane. And Jimmie,” he added,
“suppose you keep an eye on the plateau?
The lads may signal.”
</p>
<p>
“Too dark for that,” the boy replied, “but
I’ll keep a sharp lookout, just the same. Go on
and look over the man Frank found under the
mountain.”
</p>
<p>
Frank moved on up the hill, clinging to trees
as he advanced, and stooping low, even then, to
escape the force of the wind, while Jimmie stationed
himself in the opening and looked out on
the lake. Ned disappeared in the cavern, and
the boy saw his torch grow fainter as he climbed
through the narrow opening left in the rock
which had been thrown over the natural doorway.
</p>
<p>
It was getting late and the boy was sleepy,
but he struggled manfully to keep his eyes open.
Directly, however, he had no trouble in this regard,
for he started up with a strange, acrid odor
in his nostrils. The low-lying sky was aflame.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—ABOVE THE CLOUDS AT NIGHT.</h2>
<p>
The wind gained strength as the heat of the
forest fires increased. The roaring of the gale
and the heavy undertone of the racing flames
effectually drowned the voice of the forester,
and it was only by the motion of his lips that the
boys knew that he was trying to talk to them.
</p>
<p>
Presently he threw his hands high above his
head, weaponless, then lowered one and beckoned
to them. Still keeping grasp on their revolvers,
the boys approached him. His face was deadly
pale, save for the glow of the fire which shone
unnaturally on the wall behind him.
</p>
<p>
“This is no time for accusations,” he shouted.
“We must do something to check the fire.”
</p>
<p>
“What is to be done?” Jack demanded, half
won over by the apparent distress of the fellow.
</p>
<p>
“The blaze will burn itself out against the
mountains,” was the reply, shouted at the top
of the speaker’s lungs, “but the fire in the cañon
must be checked by going on ahead and felling
trees.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“Won’t it burn itself out there, too?”
asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid not,” was the shrill reply.
“There is an opening from the top of the
cañon to a valley in a fold of the hills. The
fire will do incalculable damage if it passes
through that.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose we can do against a
fire like that?” demanded Pat. “An army
could not stop the blaze now.”
</p>
<p>
“You are mistaken!” shrilled the other.
“Three choppers can clear a space which the
fire will not cross.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get our axes and try,” Jack said, reluctantly.
</p>
<p>
“Then make haste!” Greer shouted. “At all
events we must leave this place, for the fire will
soon be here. Come!”
</p>
<p>
When the boys turned to verify this statement
they saw that the planes of the aeroplane
were red with the reflection of the blaze below,
and that the creeping fire was already showing
at the lip of the plateau.
</p>
<p>
“The aeroplane is doomed, I guess,” wailed
Jack, and Pat thought he saw a look of satisfaction
in Greer’s face as the words reached
his ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
The smoke was now rolling over the plateau
in great clouds, but through it Pat thought he
saw figures moving from the south slope toward
the aeroplane. Calling out to Jack, he sprang
toward the machine, the suspicion in his mind
that these were confederates of the alleged forester,
and that the machine was, after all, the
main point of attack.
</p>
<p>
Greer saw the movement and darted toward
the boy as if to block his way, but Pat struck
out viciously and turned him back. Then a bit
of flame sprang up in the cloud of smoke which
was sweeping over the plateau. It seemed to
Pat that an attempt to burn the machine in
advance of the arrival of the forest fire was being
made.
</p>
<p>
When he darted forward again Greer caught
him by the shoulder and hurled him away.
</p>
<p>
“Get your axes!” he shouted. “There is no
time to waste here.”
</p>
<p>
Then the smoke lifted for an instant and Pat
saw three figures rise above the rim of the
northern slope and hasten toward the aeroplane.
Their arrival there was followed by shots and
calls for assistance. Then the smoke shut down
again, and the roaring of the flames drowned
all other sounds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
Greer stood for an instant, braced against
the wind, shielding his face from the hot blasts
scorching the grass of the plateau, then turned
and ran. Then both boys heard a call from the
direction of the machine.
</p>
<p>
“The way is clear to the cavern!” were the
words they heard. “Remain there until we return!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Ned,” shouted Pat. “Just in time
to save the aeroplane.”
</p>
<p>
Almost before the words were out of his
mouth there came a lull in the wind and the
great machine ran forward a few yards, then
swung into the air. At that moment Frank
came running toward the two astonished boys.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to leg it!” Frank shouted, his
mouth close to Jack’s ear. “Drop low on the
ground so as to get fresh air and run!”
</p>
<p>
Jack, although he had heard Ned’s voice
giving directions, and although he knew that
Frank was by his side, could hardly sense the
situation, or all that had taken place. The
action had been so swift that he could not yet
realize that Ned had snatched the aeroplane
away from certain destruction and lifted it into
the stormy sky in so short a time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
However, he did not stop then to place the
events in neat order in his mind, for the fire was
working across the scant vegetation of the plateau
and the air was hot and stifling. It was all
like a page out of the Arabian Nights, but he put
the wonder of it away, grasped Frank’s hand,
and, crouching, ran toward the incline leading
to the lake. There was safety there, at least.
</p>
<p>
Now and then, in their swift flight, the boys
stopped and looked upward, hoping to learn
something of the fate of the aeroplane, but the
great machine was not in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Ned never can make it live in this gale!”
Jack almost sobbed, when, at last, they all came
to a halt at the margin of the lake. “The whole
shebang will go to pieces and the boys will be
killed.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, forget it!” grunted Pat. “I’m not in
love with airships, but I know that Ned wouldn’t
have gone up unless he knew that he could handle
the machine. He’ll lift above the divide and
drive straight before the wind. The good Lord
only knows how far the gale will take him, but
I’m betting my head against turnips that he’ll
come back by morning, asking why breakfast
isn’t ready!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“How did you get wise to the trouble up
here?” Jack asked of Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I don’t exactly know,” the boy replied.
“Ned sent me on ahead to look out for
the aeroplane. He said he wanted to remain
in the cavern and investigate. I was making
slow progress up the hill when Ned and Jimmie
came running after me. I had noticed long before
that the sky looked like fires were burning
somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so,” Pat cut in. “The clouds
looked like they had been soaked in red paint.”
</p>
<p>
“When Ned came up to me, running like a
racehorse,” Frank went on, “he said he was
going to take the aeroplane out, wind or no wind.
I didn’t have much chance to talk with him, but
I understood that he was going to do just what
Pat has suggested—run before the wind and
swing back whenever he could.”
</p>
<p>
“I presume Jimmie is good and scared by
this time!” Jack commented.
</p>
<p>
“When we got to the machine,” Frank went
on, “we found two men there with some sort of
torches in their hands, trying to set the machine
on fire. We caught them unawares and left
them lying there. I hope they didn’t get burned
to death.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a short cessation of speech while
the boys listened to the roaring of the flames
and watched the fire mounting into the sky. It
was a wild scene—one calculated to bring terror
to the breast of any human being. The wind
was dying down a little, but the clouds were still
driving fast before it, their edges tinged with
flame so that they resembled golden masses
floating across an eternity of space clothed in
smoke.
</p>
<p>
While the boys watched the great display
Frank pointed to a wall of flame rounding the
corner of the plateau.
</p>
<p>
“The fire will burn this slope,” he said, “and
we’ve either got to get into the cave or out on
the lake. Which shall It be?”
</p>
<p>
“The cave for mine!” Jack cried.
</p>
<p>
“And mine,” echoed Pat. “Who knows
what the fire will do to the lake?”
</p>
<p>
But Frank had had previous experience in
the cavern. He was thinking of the still figure
he had found lying there, and of the dark stains
on the floor.
</p>
<p>
“If we could find a boat,” he said, without
mentioning his real reason for objecting to the
cave, “we might get along very well on the lake.
We don’t know what stifling air we shall find in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
the cave, and, besides, the men we have just had
a fracas with may return at any time. It
wouldn’t be nice to be locked up in that hole in
the ground.”
</p>
<p>
The wind was dying down to a steady breeze,
and the fires seemed to burn lower. The clouds
above were dark and threatening, save where
gilded by the reflection from below, and seemed
to be massing. Frank held up a hand and
shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Rain!” he cried. “Rain!”
</p>
<p>
It was no gentle spring shower that opened
upon the earth then. The fountains of the
great deep seemed to have opened wide. The
water fell in sheets, and in an instant the boys
were wet to the skin.
</p>
<p>
“Better than fire!” Jack suggested.
</p>
<p>
The rain pelted down upon the forest fires
viciously, and the hissing protests of the angry
embers rose in the air. Through the thick veil
of the rain clouds of steam could be seen rolling
over the lake and along the threatened incline.
In ten minutes water was pouring down the
steep hill in sheets and the fires were leaping no
more.
</p>
<p>
Pleased as the boys were at the opportune
arrival of the rain-bearing clouds, they could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
help wondering if the freak of chance which had
preserved the forests of northern Montana had
not brought Ned and Jimmie sudden death.
</p>
<p>
“They never can handle the machine in such
an air-ocean,” Jack declared, but the more optimistic
Pat asserted that Ned must have been
a mile above the rain clouds before a drop of
water fell.
</p>
<p>
“I guess the fire brought this rain on,”
Frank said, wiggling about in his wet garments,
“but it’s just as wet as if brought about by some
other means. What are we going to do now?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not go to the cave until the rain
stops?” asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
“It is colder in there than it is here,” Frank
said, still thinking of the silent figure in the narrow
tunnel back of the cupboard.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t get any more water in our clothes
and hides than we have now,” Jack observed,
“so we may as well stay outside and watch for
Ned and the aeroplane. I don’t believe any
other person ever took an aeroplane up in such
a storm. I’m afraid Ned was smashed against
the divide.”
</p>
<p>
“Ned’s all right,” insisted Frank. “Suppose
we go back to the plateau and see if there’s
anything left of our tents.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m game for that,” Pat said, “but,” he
added, turning a keen gaze on Frank, “I’d like
to know why you object to going to the cave.
Jack and I would like to see it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank replied, not without some
hesitation at bringing the scene in the tunnel
back to his mind in form for expression in words,
“there’s a crime been committed in the cave,
and it’s uncanny.”
</p>
<p>
“A crime!” repeated Pat, all excitement at
the suggestion of another adventure, “what kind
of a crime?”
</p>
<p>
“A murder,” replied Frank, with a shiver.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go in and see,” Pat said.
</p>
<p>
“Frank’s afraid,” Jack put in.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I’m afraid,” Frank admitted.
“You go in there, and crawl on your knees
through the thick air of a narrow tunnel, and
put your hand on a dead man’s face, and feel
your other hand slipping in the blood on the
floor, and you’ll be afraid, too. I’m not going
back there.”
</p>
<p>
“We can stand here in the rain all night, if
you want to,” Pat said, with scorn in his voice.
“Rainwater is said to be good for the complexion.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
The wind was slowing down and the rainfall
was not so heavy as before. The boys, Pat and
Jack, joking Frank about his terror for the cave,
and Frank just a little angry, began the ascent of
the slope leading to the plateau.
</p>
<p>
“The rain saved the trees next to the mountain,”
Pat said, presently, “and if it checked the
fire on the plateau at the same line our tents are
all right. Say,” he added, “who ever heard of
such a downpour as that. I reckon the rain
swept in from the ocean in heavy clouds which
were broken open by the mountains.”
</p>
<p>
“Much you know about it!” laughed Jack.
“You talk as if you could cut a cloud with a
knife.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” persisted Pat, “the water tumbled
out and checked the fires. Wonder what
became of the man who said his name was Greer?
He was standing in with the men who were trying
to burn the aeroplane, all right enough, and
I believe the whole circus was started just to
destroy the airship and bring Ned’s investigations
to a close.”
</p>
<p>
“We always do get into the thick of it at the
first jump,” Frank said, remembering the bomb
under the cottage in the Canal Zone and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
raid on the nipa hut in the Philippines. “Whenever
we’ve got anything coming to us, we get it
by lightning express.”
</p>
<p>
“You bet we do!” Jack exclaimed. “Now
we’re getting a clear sky,” he added, pointing
upward, “and we’re getting it short order time,
too!”
</p>
<p>
The heavy clouds were gone, the moon was
smiling down on the drenched earth, the stars
were winking significantly toward a spot on the
plateau where two unrecognizable figures, half
burned away, were lying. When the boys
reached the top of the climb and advanced to the
spot where the aeroplane had stood they turned
sick with the horror of the thing.
</p>
<p>
“I almost wish we had let them destroy
the aeroplane,” sighed Frank. “I don’t like
to think that these men came to their death
through us. It is awful!”
</p>
<p>
“Did you shoot them?” asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
Frank shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“They shot at us,” he said. “They fired
as soon as we got to the rim of the dip, but missed
because of the smoke and the wind. Then we
rushed them, and they went down—to escape
punishment, I thought—and so Ned got the
aeroplane away.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then you had nothing to do with their
death,” consoled Pat. “They came here to
commit a crime and were overcome by the smoke
and heat.”
</p>
<p>
Frank would gladly have accepted this version
of what had taken place, but he could not
bring his mind to do so at once. The horror of
what he had found in the cave was still upon
him.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the spot where what remained of
the outlaws lay, the boys hastened to the wall
of rock which terminated the plateau on the east.
The rain had indeed saved the tents from destruction.
The canvas was huddled against the
wall, stained with smoke and heavy with rain,
but in fairly good condition.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to remain here, or about here,
until Ned comes,” Pat said, “so we may as well
put the tents up. I wonder if it isn’t most
morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Does that mean that you are getting hungry?”
grinned Jack.
</p>
<p>
“You bet it does!” was the reply. “Anyway,
I’m going to see if I can find dry wood
enough for a fire. If I can I’ll make some hot
coffee. Ned will see the fire, and know we are
not in the cave.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
Then an exclamation from Frank called the
speaker’s attention to the clear sky over the divide.
The upper strata of clouds were drifting
westward on a high current of air—what few
clouds there were—and far up in the blue, the
moonlight trimming the planes with silver, rode
the aeroplane, seemingly intact, and working
back on the high current toward the Pacific
coast.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—A KEY WITH A BROKEN STEM.</h2>
<p>
The lights were burning low in a bachelor
flat on a noisy street corner in the city of San
Francisco, and a man of perhaps thirty lay on
a couch with his eyes closed. There were in
this sitting room, which faced one of the noisy
streets, a grand piano, a costly music cabinet, a
walnut bookcase filled with expensively bound
volumes, numerous lazy chairs of leather, and
the rug on the polished floor was rich and soft.
The occupant of the flat evidently enjoyed
luxurious things and had the money to pay
for them.
</p>
<p>
When a clock in a distant steeple struck midnight
there came a knock at the locked door in
the main corridor which connected with the
private hallway on which the flat opened. A
Japanese servant, small, obsequious, keen-eyed,
opened the door, after the hesitation of a moment,
and peeked out. He would have closed
it again instantly, seeing a stranger there, only
Ned Nestor, who had anticipated some action
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
of the kind, thrust a shoe into the opening, and,
reaching in, unfastened the chain.
</p>
<p>
“I wish to see Mr. Albert Lemon,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The Jap tried to force the door back and lock
it, but was unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy!” he cried, as Ned brushed past
him and stood in the private hall.
</p>
<p>
Ned paid no further attention to him, but
entered the sitting room and at once advanced to
the couch where the man lay. The figure on the
couch did not move, but the Jap forced himself in
the boy’s way with his cry of “no savvy!”
</p>
<p>
“Opium?” Ned asked, pointing down to
the man.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy!”
</p>
<p>
“Hit the pipe?” he asked, putting the question
in a new way.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy! No savvy!”
</p>
<p>
“Dope, then?” Ned went on. “Tell me if
this man has been doping himself into unconsciousness.
Dope, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Ned lifted his voice, half hoping that the
man on the couch would show some signs of life,
but there was no movement of the eyelids.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy!” grunted the Jap.
</p>
<p>
Ned took the servant by his shoulders,
pushed him gently out of the room, and closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
and locked the door, the key being in the lock
on the inside.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy! No savvy!”
</p>
<p>
The words came through the thin panel of
the door in quick succession for a minute and
then silence. Again Ned advanced to the side
of the couch and looked down upon the semi-unconscious
man.
</p>
<p>
It was clear to the boy that the fellow sensed
what was taking place, but was too well satisfied
with the drugged condition in which he lay
to disturb his poise of mind by taking note of
anything whatever. The figure of the fellow
was dressed in expensive clothes of latest cut,
but they were soiled, and even torn in places.
</p>
<p>
The disreputable condition of the garments
reminded Ned of a suit in which he had once
been hauled through a briar patch and pulled
into a pond at the hands, or horns, rather, of a
village cow, assisted by a rope. His clothes, it
is true, had not been expensive ones at the time
of the occurrence, but the looks of the clothes
the drugged man wore reminded him of the
damage his cheaper ones had sustained.
</p>
<p>
The face of the man on the couch was deadly
pale, with the drawn look about the skin which
comes of much familiarity with the drug made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
of the poppy. It was still an attractive face,
even in its degradation, and the forehead was
that of a capable man.
</p>
<p>
Ned drew a chair to the side of the couch
and sat down. Even if he should at that time
succeed in attracting the attention of the man,
the fellow was in no condition to answer the
important questions he was there to ask.
</p>
<p>
Presently the Jap, or some one else, came
and rapped lightly on the door, and Ned opened
it a trifle and looked out.
</p>
<p>
“No savvy!” cried the Jap, repeating the
words like a parrot, standing in the hall with
many signs of fright on his yellow face.
</p>
<p>
“All right!” Ned said, shutting the door in
his face, “you don’t have to.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t blame him for thinking this a cheeky
invasion,” Ned smiled, as he returned to his
chair at the side of the couch. “It isn’t exactly
the thing to walk into a man’s private
room in this manner.”
</p>
<p>
Ned had decided to sit by the side of the
half conscious man until he returned to his full
mentality. Questions now might produce only
pipe dreams, for the imagination is rather too
active under such circumstances.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
Five days before Ned had left the boys in a
cup on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains,
not far from the summit, after explaining
to them that he was going to the city to investigate
a clue connected with the murder of the
man who had been found in the cavern. Leaving
the aeroplane safely hidden at Missoula, he
had traveled by rail to San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
In his handbag on this trip were two seemingly
unimportant articles—a piece of tape cut
from the inner side of the collar of the dead
man’s coat, and a small, odd-shaped key with the
stem broken off so that it was only about an inch
in length. The key had been the only article
found in the dead man’s pockets. The strip
of tape bore the name of a San Francisco tailor.
</p>
<p>
The directory had assisted him in finding
the tailor, and the tailor had informed him that
the coat had been made for one Albert Lemon,
whose address he gave. So here he was, in
Lemon’s apartment, seeking information concerning
the dead man, while Lemon, supposedly
Lemon, lay in an opium daze on the couch.
</p>
<p>
But Ned’s time, waiting for the man to come
back to consciousness, was not all wasted. Moving
carefully about the room, he found that the
broken key fitted a writing desk which stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
between two windows. The lock which it fitted,
however, was not in good condition, for the bolt
had been pried back, damaging the polished edge
of the casing which held the socket. The desk
contained nothing of importance, and Ned left
it as he found it.
</p>
<p>
Sitting there in the soft light of the room, he
did not know whether the man on the couch
was Albert Lemon or whether the man who had
died in the cavern was Albert Lemon. He believed,
however, that the outlaws he had encountered
in the mountains, had murdered the
man, and felt that the surest way to trace the
crime to them was to find out why the man had
joined them—why he was there in the tunnel
back of the cupboard. This would be likely to
bring out a motive for the deed.
</p>
<p>
He did not, of course, know whether the dead
man had stood as an enemy to the outlaws, or
whether he had stood as a friend. But that
could make no difference with the quest he was
on. He believed that the outlaws were the men
he had been instructed to hunt down, and knew
that proof could be obtained only by an intimate
knowledge of their associations, their ways,
their motives. The friends of the dead man he
thought, would know something about them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
perhaps be able to place them in the circle in
which they lived when not in the hills.
</p>
<p>
In work of this kind it is the first task of an
investigator to “place” the man he is pursuing.
The burglar is as good as taken when he is traced
back to those he associates with in his hours of
leisure. In the absence of a clue pointing to a
person, the investigator busies himself in finding
a motive. Ned believed that he now had the
personal clue. The motive would place the
proof in his hands.
</p>
<p>
So his Secret Service work for the government
was leading him into the investigation of
a murder mystery. He smiled as he held up the
key and wondered if the facts when discovered
would bear out the suspicions in his mind.
Again he asked himself the question:
</p>
<p>
“Is this Albert Lemon, or was the dead man
Albert Lemon?”
</p>
<p>
After a long time the man on the couch
opened his eyes and looked about the room.
His glance rested for an instant on the figure in
the chair at his side, but the fact of its being
there did not appear to surprise him in the least.
</p>
<p>
“Jap!” he called faintly.
</p>
<p>
There was a sound at the door, but it was
still locked, and the servant was unable to obey
the summons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bring me a pipe!” were the next words.
</p>
<p>
The Jap clamored at the door, but did not
gain admission. The racket seemed to disturb
the man not at all.
</p>
<p>
“I think,” Ned said, “that you have had
all the dope you need to-night. Besides, I want
you to answer a few questions.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I have,” the man said, “but, supposing
that to be the case, where do you come in?
You are a new one on me, and I hope you won’t
flop out of a window or go up through the roof, as
some of the others have done. I want to have
congenial company to-night. Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Ned Nestor,” was the quiet reply.
</p>
<p>
“So,” said the man on the couch. “I’ve
heard of you—read about you and the Canal
Zone in the newspapers. But you’re only a kid.
What about that?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t help being young,” laughed Ned.
“Anyway, that is a fault I’ll soon get over. We
all have it at first.”
</p>
<p>
“And get over it too quickly,” said the other,
with a sigh. “Well, what do you want here?”
</p>
<p>
“Are you Albert Lemon?” asked Ned abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply, “I’m Albert Lemon.
What about it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
The man was gaining mental strength every
moment now, and seemed to sense the strange
situation.
</p>
<p>
“Stiles is your tailor?” the boy went on.
</p>
<p>
“Look here,” said the other, rising to a sitting
position and passing a shaking hand across
his brow, as if to brush away the fancies of the
poppy, “when you convince me that you have
a laudable interest in my personal affairs I’ll be
glad to answer your questions.”
</p>
<p>
Ned took the strip of tape from his pocket
and held it out to the man on the couch.
</p>
<p>
“Do you recognize that?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Lemon nodded coolly, but a look of wonder
and alarm was growing in his bloodshot eyes,
and his jaw dropped a trifle.
</p>
<p>
“I still lack the proof of laudable interest,”
he said, with a twisting of the face intended for
a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Answer the question,” Ned replied, “and
I’ll inform you of my interest in this article—and
in you.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I recognize it as the private mark of
Stiles, my tailor,” Lemon answered, in a moment.
“Where did you get it? If you insist
on asking personal questions I must insist on
the right to do the same thing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“I cut this private mark,” Ned said, “from
the collar of a coat found on the back of a dead
man in Montana, somewhere near the main divide
of the Rocky Mountains. Do you know
how it came there?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes and no,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Kindly answer the affirmative proposition
first,” Ned said, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the other, “about three months
ago an old college friend of mine, one Felix Emory,
came to me from Boston. He was in bad
with his people, and was out of money. I took
him in here and tried to brace him up. I
couldn’t do it. His moral stamina was gone.”
</p>
<p>
Lemon paused a moment, and, with a deprecatory
smile, pointed to an opium pipe which
lay on the rug near the couch.
</p>
<p>
“I understand,” Ned said.
</p>
<p>
“I fed him, and clothed him, and introduced
him at the club, and gave him every chance in
the world to get a brace, but he fought me off.
All he cared for was a pipe and a pill and a place
to sleep it off.”
</p>
<p>
“And so you gave him up as a bad proposition?”
asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Not exactly. He wanted to go to the mountains
on a hunting trip. Well, I thought it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
benefit his health, so I rigged up an outfit for
his use and let him go. You say the man was
dead?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite dead,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“Too much poppy, I presume?” Lemon
asked with an ashamed smile.
</p>
<p>
“Too much steel,” Ned answered, sharply.
</p>
<p>
Lemon stared at the boy for an instant, his
eyes more anxious than ever, and arose shakingly
to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean that he was murdered?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
Ned nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” was the next question.
</p>
<p>
“I found the body in a cavern on the western
slope of the Rockies,” was the reply. “He had
been dead only a few hours.”
</p>
<p>
Albert Lemon maintained a thoughtful silence
for a time, during which Ned eyed his
changing expression keenly.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you wish me to do about it?”
he then asked.
</p>
<p>
“A crime has been committed,” Ned replied,
“and it seems to me that you ought to do all in
your power to assist in bringing the criminal to
punishment.”
</p>
<p>
“Granted, sir. Tell me what to do.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
“First, tell me about the men your friend
went away with.”
</p>
<p>
“That brings me to the negative proposition,”
the other answered. “I have told you
how Felix came by my coat, but I can’t tell you
whether the man the coat was found on was
Felix. You must see that for yourself. He
might have given the garment away, or he might
have sold it in the city to get money for opium.
In short, the coat might have been on the body
of a man I never saw.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you can’t tell me who Emory went
away with?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” was the reply. “I don’t
know whether he went away at all or not.”
</p>
<p>
This was disappointing, but Ned had one
more lever with which the man’s indifference
might be lifted, he thought. Before speaking
again Lemon arose and turned the key in the
lock of the door, against which the servant was
still pounding. The Jap entered and stood by
the door, looking intently at Ned.
</p>
<p>
“When you gave him the suit of clothes he
went away in,” the boy went on, shifting his
position so that both men would be under his
eyes, “what articles, if any, remained in the
pockets?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing,” was the reply. “I looked
out for that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then anything discovered in the pockets
of the dead man,” Ned said, taking the key
from his pocket and toying carelessly with it,
“must have belonged to him?”
</p>
<p>
Ned saw Lemon give a quick start at sight
of the key. The Jap advanced a step as if to
get a closer view of it. Then both men turned
their eyes for an instant to the broken lock of
the writing desk. Ned had gained his point.
The men recognized the key.
</p>
<p>
“Where is the body you speak of?” Lemon
asked, presently.
</p>
<p>
“Buried near the cavern in the mountains,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you can give me a description of
the body,” Lemon said. “I might be able to
say, then, whether the man was Felix.”
</p>
<p>
“Look in the mirror,” Ned replied, “and
you will see there a fairly good representation of
the dead man. About the same in height, in
size, and, yes, in feature.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it must have been Felix,” the other
said. “His remarkable resemblance to myself has
often been remarked. Poor fellow! I’m sorry
that his end should come in so ghastly a form.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a short silence, during which Lemon’s
eyes flitted from the key in Ned’s fingers to
the writing desk.
</p>
<p>
“I said a moment ago,” he observed then,
“that I searched the pockets of the clothes
before I gave them to him, or words to that
effect. I remember now that I ordered Jap to
do it. Did you obey orders?” he asked, turning
to the servant.
</p>
<p>
Ned saw the Jap give a quick start, then
regain control of himself. Lemon, too, looked
crestfallen for a moment, then addressed the
Jap in another tongue.
</p>
<p>
“I was talking in English,” he said, “and
forgot for the moment that he would not understand
me.”
</p>
<p>
There followed a short conversation between
the two, and then Lemon announced that the
Jap had forgotten to look in the pockets of the
clothes. Ned ignored the explanation and put
the key in his pocket. He knew now that the
Jap could understand English, and also that the
key belonged to Albert Lemon, alive or dead.

<p>
Lemon arose and, going to a table, secured
a tobacco pouch and a book of cigaret papers.
As he rolled a cigaret Ned observed that the
middle finger of his left hand carried, just
below the nail, a blue spot, as if he had been using
a typewriter since cleaning his hands. Ned noticed
it particularly, as he himself used a double
keyboard machine and usually smutted that
finger on the ribbon when he rolled the platen.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Lemon said, “I’ll have to ask you
to excuse me now. I’ve been off on a long
country tramp. You see how mussed up I am.
I think I crawled through briar patches and wire
fences and fell into cow ponds.”
</p>
<p>
Ned turned away without a word, with plenty
of food for thought in his mind.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—FATE OF THE STEAK A LA BRIGAND.</h2>
<p>
Jimmie lay stretched at full length under one
of the discolored shelter tents in a little cup in
the heart of the Rocky Mountains. Frank and
Pat and Jack were moving restlessly about, looking
up at the blue sky expectantly. Ned had
not returned from his trip to San Francisco,
and the boys were anxious as to his safety.
</p>
<p>
“He should have taken me with him,” Jimmie
drawled, presently, when Frank threw himself
down by the tent. “Then he’d have been
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a wonder that he got along in the
world at all before he fell under your protecting
care,” Frank replied, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he managed in some way,” Jimmie
answered, “but he never got up in the world until
he took me into partnership,” with a wink
at his chum.
</p>
<p>
“He’s been up in the world since then, all
right,” Frank said, suggestively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Too high up,” Jimmie grinned. “Too high
up for me, anyway. I thought I’d die up there,
on the night of the fire.”
</p>
<p>
“In all the history of air navigation,” Frank
observed, soberly, “there was never a trip like
that. When I think of the quick start, and the
wind and the rain, the whole thing seems like a
dream. How did he ever do it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” Jimmie replied. “He
boosted me into the seat, and the next I knew
we were off, an’ the fire was dropping away from
us, an’ the mountains were growing smaller, an’
the peaks looked like warts on the world. I
felt like I was fallin’ over the edge of somethin’.”
</p>
<p>
“And the wind?” questioned Frank. “Didn’t
it take your breath away?”
</p>
<p>
“Wind, nothin’,” the boy said, scornfully.
“There wasn’t any wind where we were. We
went along with it. It was like sailin’ on a swift
stream. Ned tuned the engine up to keep
steerway, an’ shut his teeth. Then, in half a
minute, we were above the clouds, an’ the moon
an’ stars were askin’ what we were doin’ up
there.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re saying it well,” Pat said, joining
the little group. “If you were going so merrily
before the wind, why did he want steerway?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know much about the atmosphere,”
laughed Frank, answering for Jimmie.
“If you did, you’d know that the air blanket of
the earth is a good deal like a river. It has eddies,
and currents, and ripples, and holes, too.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re good, too!” exclaimed Pat. “Holes
in the air is about the best I ever heard!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course there are holes in the air,” Frank
replied, with the air of one imparting valuable
information, “especially when there are fires beneath.
And, let me tell you this, you old red-head,”
he added, with an exasperating grin,
“when the air, driven swiftly by the wind, or
what we call the wind, comes to mountain peaks,
and tall trees, and sky-scrapers, it just backs up,
just the same as water does when it comes to a
dam, or any obstruction.”
</p>
<p>
“Go it!” Pat cried. “Make it a good one!
Where does this air go when it backs up?”
</p>
<p>
“It just hunches up,” Frank replied, gravely,
“and checks the flow back of it, and then eddies
and swirls away, fit to twist an aeroplane into
kindling wood.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” broke in Jimmie. “I’ve often
read of aeroplanes dropping a thousand feet into
holes in the air, and of their being swept against
tall trees and buildings by eddies. It takes a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
cool head to run an air machine in a storm of
wind, and that is where Ned won out.”
</p>
<p>
“If he hadn’t kept the aeroplane going with
the wind at full speed,” Frank added, “he would
have been in a wreck the first half mile.”
</p>
<p>
“The more I learn about the atmosphere,”
Pat said, “the less I like it. When you get me
up in an aeroplane, just send word to the folks
that I’m tired of life.”
</p>
<p>
“Ned ought to have a Carnegie medal for
what he did that night,” Jack remarked, “and
I’m going to speak to father about it when I get
home.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no doubt that he ought to have
one,” Frank said, “but the men who really deserve
Carnegie medals never get them.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re an anarchist!” roared Pat.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” was the sober reply, “but if I
had the giving out of the medals I’d present
them to men who work twelve hours a day and
provide for families of eight on nine dollars a
week—the men who never get rested, and who
never have enough to eat. They are the ones
who ought to have the medals.”
</p>
<p>
“Most of them would sell the medals,” Jack
said, cynically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank replied, “I shouldn’t blame
them if they did. I’d rather have a porterhouse
steak in the interior than a piece of bronze on
the outside.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk about porterhouse steak!” pleaded
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Hungry, little man?” asked Pat.
</p>
<p>
“Hungry! I’m like one of the men Frank
has been telling about. I never get rested,
never have enough to eat.”
</p>
<p>
The boys fell upon Jimmie and rolled him
out of the tent.
</p>
<p>
“You get busy with fuel,” Pat said, after
they had given him plenty of “movements,”
“and I’ll cook a steak à la brigand.”
</p>
<p>
“We ain’t got no steak,” complained Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got potatoes, and bacon, and onions,”
Pat said, “and canned beefsteak. You just
watch me. I used to cook steak à la brigand in
the Philippines.”
</p>
<p>
“Get busy, then,” Jimmie said, “and Jack
will help get the green wood.”
</p>
<p>
“If you bring green wood here for me to
cook with, I’ll roast you over it,” Pat said.
“You get a lot of good dry wood that will make
coals, and I’ll show you how to broil a steak à
la brigand.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why do you call it a brigand steak?” asked
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Because it takes a red-headed brigand to
cook it,” suggested Jack, dodging out of Pat’s
reach.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind the name,” Pat replied.
“Get the dry wood and I’ll broil a steak that will
melt in the mouth.”
</p>
<p>
“That old canned stuff?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Get the wood,” ordered Pat, “and I’ll show
you.”
</p>
<p>
There were a few dead trees—the sole reminders
of a former forest fire in that green valley—close
at hand, and the wood was soon gathered
and placed in a great pile near two rocks
which Pat had rolled to within a yard of each
other.
</p>
<p>
“Here!” Jack called out, as Pat transferred
the whole supply to the space between the
stones, “there’s enough fuel there for a week’s
cooking. Quit it!”
</p>
<p>
“My son,” Pat replied, with a provoking air
of patronage, “what you don’t know about
broiling a steak à la brigand would make a congressional
library.”
</p>
<p>
While the wood was burning down to coals,
Pat cut a green slip about an inch in diameter
at the bottom and peeled and smoothed it nicely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is that to be used to enforce the eating of
the steak?” asked Frank, winking at the others.
</p>
<p>
“To keep you from gorging yourselves,” Pat
replied, going on with his work.
</p>
<p>
In a short time he had the potatoes cut into
half-inch slices. Jack had peeled them and, following
directions with many grins, had also cut
a round hole an inch in size in the middle of each
slice.
</p>
<p>
“He’s going to wear ’em around his neck,
like beads,” Jimmie suggested, looking carefully
over the heaped-up dish.
</p>
<p>
The bacon was now sliced thin, as were the
onions, and in the center of each slice a round
hole was made. Then Pat opened a couple of
tins of beefsteak—so called by the packers—and
cut a hole in the middle of each slice.
Then he strung a slice of potato on the spit,
then a slice of bacon, then a slice of onion, then
a slice of beef, until there was nearly a yard
of provisions.
</p>
<p>
“I begin to feel hungrier than ever!”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie was dancing around the fire as Pat
turned the spit. There were only coals now,
and Pat kept the toothsome collection turning
slowly, so as to broil without scorching. The
smell of the cooking bacon and onions set the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
boys to getting out the tin plates and making
the coffee.
</p>
<p>
The sun, which had been shining fiercely all
day, now seemed to be working his way through
a mist. The atmosphere appeared to be tinted
with the yellow haze one sees in the northern
states in autumn.
</p>
<p>
As the boys were keeping watch for Ned and
the aeroplane, they noticed the change in atmospheric
conditions, but attributed it to the
rising vapor brought out by the heat of the sun.
</p>
<p>
“Say,” Jimmie said, presently, “I smell
smoke. I wonder if there’s goin’ to be another
forest blaze here?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you smell smoke,” Jack said,
watching the broiling supper. “We’re cooking
a steak à la brigand, ain’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Smells like burnin’ leaves,” Jimmie insisted.
</p>
<p>
“More like onions,” Pat observed.
</p>
<p>
The boys crouched about the fire for some
moments longer and then Jimmie arose and began
to climb the wall of the cup to the west.
</p>
<p>
“I’m goin’ to see about this,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Frank laid a hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>
“You wait a minute,” he said. “You can’t
climb that slope in less than half an hour, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
Ned will be here before that. Look! He’s
coming now, like the wind!”
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane, high up in the hazy sky, was
indeed making good progress toward the little
cup in the mountain side. While the boys
looked they saw it shift away to the west, whirl
back to the east, dart off to the north and back
again.
</p>
<p>
“He’s huntin’ for us,” Jimmie said.
</p>
<p>
“He’s investigating!” Frank cut in.
</p>
<p>
“Investigating what?” Pat demanded.
“He’s smelling of this steak à la brigand and is
hunting for it. Let be. He’ll find us.”
</p>
<p>
The sky was growing more uncertain every
minute, and puffs of smoke were seen out in the
west, over the rim of the cup.
</p>
<p>
“The world is on fire, I tell you!” Jimmie
cried, presently. “That’s what Ned is shiftin’
about for. If the blaze wasn’t high up on the
mountains we couldn’t see the columns of smoke
over the rim of the valley.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Pat observed, “the fire can’t get in
here. Nothing to burn.”
</p>
<p>
“It can fill the cup with hot air and scorch
us to death,” Frank said, uneasily. “I think
we’d better be looking about for a place to crawl
into.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait until Ned comes,” Jimmie suggested.
“He’ll know what to do.”
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane acted badly in the currents
caused by the burning forest, but Ned finally
managed to bring it down in the valley. The
boys gathered about him, all excitement, and
the steak à la brigand was for the moment forgotten
in the joy at the return of the patrol
leader and the anxiety to learn something of
conditions out in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be a great conflagration,” Ned
said, “but I think the aeroplane will be safe
here. The whole slope is on fire.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t take chances on leaving it here,”
Frank advised. “I’d jump over the divide with
it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have been in the air three hours now,”
Ned replied, “and must have a rest. Besides,
we must remain where we can, if necessary, help
head off the flames. That is what we are here
for, remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to fight fires,” corrected Frank, “but
to find out who sets them.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” Ned replied, “we must fight the
fire, if it gives us a chance, now that we are here.
Now, what do you think that is?” he added,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
as a chorus of howls and cries came up from the
slope on the west.
</p>
<p>
“Sounds like a country circus!” Jimmie
laughed.
</p>
<p>
“That is just what it is!” Ned exclaimed.
“Here! Help me roll the aeroplane into that
nook, where it won’t be trampled into splinters.
Now you boys get behind it, and I’ll get in front.
Whatever you see or hear, don’t shoot unless
you are actually attacked.”
</p>
<p>
The boys obeyed the commands without a
word of comment, well knowing what was coming
next. A breeze was sliding up the slope,
bringing with it flying masses of smoke. Presently
birds began to stagger through the heavy
atmosphere, flying low, almost within reaching
distance, as they had fled long before the mounting
flames and were exhausted.
</p>
<p>
“I wish this would let up a moment,” Pat
said, “long enough for us to reach that steak
à la brigand. It must be about done by this
time.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go an’ get it,” volunteered Jimmie.
“An’ eat most of it on the way back.”
</p>
<p>
“Then bring the coffee,” cried Jack.
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t we all go out there and eat?”
asked Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys were about starting with a rush
when Ned caught two of them by the arm and
stopped the others by a quick call. Through the
smoke and the hot air on the rim of the cup, a
great head, a head neither white nor black, but
grizzly, was seen. Then a deer bounded over
and crouched down in the valley. Next two
mountain lions raced over the lip of the valley
and halted growling, within a few yards of the
boys.
</p>
<p>
“There goes our steak à la brigand!” Jimmie
cried, as the rush of frightened animals
showed under the smoke. “I’ll eat one of them
deer to pay for this,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be lucky if one of these wild animals
doesn’t eat you,” Jack said. “How would you
like to be back in little old Washington Square
just now?”
</p>
<p>
“Forget it!” was the boy’s only reply.
</p>
<p>
“Will the fire get here?” Frank asked of
Ned, as the wild creatures of the forest poured
into the valley, regardless of the presence of the
boys, unmindful of the proximity of each other.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think the flames will come into the
cup,” Ned replied, “but if the smoke settles
here we shall have a hot time of it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” Jimmie cried. “The whole valley
is full of mountain lions, an’ bears, an’ deer, an’
snakes, an’ rabbits. There ain’t no room for
any smoke!”
</p>
<p>
Then the smoke rolled away for an instant,
showing a sun as red as a piece of molten iron;
showing, too, a huddle of forest animals crowding
together in the center of the valley. In
their terror of the fire they had forgotten to be
afraid of mankind—of each other!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—THE CHAOS OF A BURNING WORLD.</h2>
<p>
That was a day long to be remembered in the
Great Northwest. It is true that the destruction
of life and property at that time by no means
equaled the ruin wrought by the forest fires of
August, 1910, but the conflagration was serious
in its final results for all that.
</p>
<p>
In August of the previous year half a hundred
persons lost their lives in the fierce fires
which swept over portions of Idaho and Montana,
and more than six billion feet of lumber
were destroyed. At that time wild animals
raced into the log houses of settlers in order to
escape the flames. In one instance, placed on
record by a forester, a mountain lion actually
sought shelter under a bed.
</p>
<p>
In that case, too, the fire virtually held its
ruthless way until it burned itself out, as there
were no trails, no telephones, no provisions for
the fire fighters. The men of the forest patrol were
each guarding a hundred thousand acres. In the
more civilized countries of Europe, a thousand
acres is considered a large district for one man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
It was hot and close in the odd little valley
on the mountain side. There seemed a premonition
of greater danger in the very air—the
lifeless air which seemed to dry the lungs beyond
power of action. The wind, coming over
the blazing forests, struck hot upon the face and
scorched the lips, while the acrid smoke filled
the eyes, the ears, the nostrils.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Ned that everything east of the
Kootenai river must be on fire. Now and then,
drawn by some wayward current of air, the
thick smoke lifted in the little cup-like valley,
and the cowering wild animals could be seen,
huddling together in the terror of the time, deer
no longer afraid of lion or bear, lion and bear
forgetting to mark their prey.
</p>
<p>
Finally, anxious to know the extent of the
disaster, so far as it might be judged by a personal
view of the country west of the valley,
Ned left the boys in charge of the aeroplane and
crept toward the rim of the cup. Jimmie saw
him leaving and started on after him, but Jack
drew him back.
</p>
<p>
“Let him go alone, for once,” Jack said,
“he’s only going to find out where this menagerie
of wild animals comes from.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
Jimmie settled sullenly back by Jack’s side,
resolved to break away at the first opportunity
and follow the patrol leader.
</p>
<p>
When Ned gained the elevation he sought,
the procession of wild animals had come to an
end, although birds, frightened and singed by
the flames, were calling from the sky. Everywhere
rolled billows of smoke, blown on ahead
of the line of fire and in a measure concealing
its fatal advance.
</p>
<p>
Now and then, however, a spurt of hot wind
came over the burned waste and lifted the curtain
for an instant. Then the boy saw that the
fire was crawling up the slope, not racing as
it had earlier in the day, but moving steadily,
sweeping the earth of the undergrowth, but
leaving many large trees.
</p>
<p>
The danger was decreasing there, but lower
down the flames were consuming everything in
their path, eating down great trees and leaving
fiery, straggling columns to consume them to
ashes. Ned thanked his stars that the growths
on the slope were not dense enough to foster
such a blaze as that which burned below.
</p>
<p>
It has been stated by those who know that
ordinary care would have prevented most of the
devastating forest fires which have raged in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
Northwest. Experts claim that forests should
be burned over under careful supervision, every
three or four years. This, they say, will prevent
the accumulation of inflammable material such
as caused the terrible losses of August, 1910.
</p>
<p>
Ned saw at once the expediency of the proposed
remedy. He knew that resinous spines,
steeped in the drippings of pitch and turp from
the overhead branches, had lain many inches
deep around the trunks of the trees, beneath
fallen boles, and at the roots of the undergrowth.
This accumulation made the extinguishing of
forest fires impossible. He understood that the
government had virtually provided for what
followed by permitting this material to accumulate
year after year.
</p>
<p>
It is declared by foresters and others who
strove to check that wall of fire that it advanced
at the rate of a mile a minute between the Kootenai
river and the foothills. Below where Ned
lay was a burning furnace. It was so hot that
he dare not lift his face a second time, and so he
moved back to the aeroplane, which he found
still safe from the flames, and the wild creatures
crouching in the center of the valley.
</p>
<p>
“What are the prospects?” Frank asked,
speaking with his lips close to the ear of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
patrol leader, for the roaring of the flames rendered
ordinary conversation difficult.
</p>
<p>
“There is safety here,” Ned replied, “but
everything to the west seems to be burning.”
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” Jimmie cried, looking Ned in the
face, “how would you like to meet a friend
with a basket of ice?”
</p>
<p>
“Ice wouldn’t last long here,” Frank said.
</p>
<p>
“Not if I got hold of it!” Jimmie grunted.
</p>
<p>
As the line of fire came nearer to the top of
the slope the air grew hotter, the smoke denser
and more stifling. Pat remembered that a pail
of water from a spring had been brought to the
vicinity of the aeroplane soon after Ned landed,
and the boys wet their handkerchiefs and bound
them over their eyes and mouths.
</p>
<p>
As the heat increased the wild creatures
crowding together ominously. When a feeble
beast was trampled by a stronger one, or when
a rattler struck at the leg of a bear or deer, there
was a cry of pain and a quick milling of the pack.
</p>
<p>
“If this doesn’t end soon,” Frank shouted
to Ned through his handkerchief, “there will be
a stampede here. Then it will be all off for us.”
</p>
<p>
Ned looked around the little circle before
replying. The boys certainly looked like “white
caps” with their sheeted faces.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to wait and hope for the best,”
he said. “If the animals come this way, we
must stop them, so far as we are able, with our
guns and electric flashlights.”
</p>
<p>
Presently night fell, and the wind quieted a
little at the setting of the sun. In a short time
the clouds rolled away in sullen, threatening
groups, and the stars looked down on the forest
tragedy. Later, there would be moonlight.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if all the world is burned, except
just this mountain?” Jimmie asked, taking the
handkerchief from his face and wiping the smoke
out of his inflamed eyes. “It looks that way.”
</p>
<p>
“There seems to be enough left to hold a lot
of heat,” Jack said. “I don’t believe it will
ever be cool again.”
</p>
<p>
“If we’d only saved that brigand steak!”
wailed Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
With the half light and the cooler air there
came a commotion in the mass of forest creatures
in the center of the valley. It was night now,
and they seemed to feel the mounting of their
wild instincts to be up and away on the hunt.
</p>
<p>
Under the stars, one by one, they slunk away,
bears and mountain lions turning sullenly toward
the lesser beasts, but still too terrified by
what they had passed through to feel the pangs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
of hunger. In half an hour the menagerie had
vanished, some to the mountain, some over the
slopes to the north and south. The boys drew
long breaths of relief when the shambling figure
of the last bear disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Once Jack drew his gun on a fat old buck
who seemed desirous of investigating the aeroplane,
but Ned saw the action and checked the
slaughter.
</p>
<p>
“Let him alone,” he said. “He’s lived
through this hell on earth, so give him one more
chance.”
</p>
<p>
The boys now began gathering up their scattered
utensils, restaking the tents, and preparing
supper. Jimmie proposed another brigand steak,
but Pat insisted that he never wanted to get near
enough to a fire to cook again, so they made an
indifferent meal of biscuit and tinned pork and
beans, not even going to the trouble to boil coffee.
</p>
<p>
While they were eating a gunshot came from
the east, followed by the challenge of a chanticleer.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about that?” demanded
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” Jack complained, “that we’ve
been eating a picked-up supper within a few
rods of a farmhouse, or cattle ranch!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“You might pry open some of the rocks
back there,” Pat observed, with sarcasm, “and
see if you can find the house you speak of. It
was a human throat that crow came from.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure it was!” cried Jimmie. “It was a
Boy Scout call. Now just see me get him to
talking.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s a Rooster patrol chap doing here!”
asked Jack. “I guess we are all having bad
dreams.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did not reply. Instead he put his
hands to his throat and in a second a long snarling
wolf cry came forth, rising into a shrill call,
as if summoning a pack at a distance.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see what he knows about that,” the
boy said.
</p>
<p>
As they listened the challenge of the chanticleer
came once more. This time Jack answered
it with the growl of a black bear, which seemed
to Frank to be a great improvement on his practice
stunts in the Black Bear Patrol club rooms
in New York.
</p>
<p>
This odd exchange of greetings kept up for
some moments, and then the figure of a boy
of perhaps seventeen was seen in the uncertain
light, making slow progress down the mountain,
a short distance to the north. He carried a haversack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
on his shoulders and was dressed in the
khaki uniform of the Boy Scouts of America.
</p>
<p>
“He must be used to mountain work,” Jack
remarked, as the boy leaped lightly from ledge
to ledge and finally dropped into the valley. “I
couldn’t do that, even in broad daylight, to save
my life!”
</p>
<p>
The stranger now advanced to the group of
boys and gave them the half salute of the Boy
Scouts, standing with right arm straight out
from the shoulder, palm outward, three fingers
standing vertical, the thumb crossing the palm
to rest on the bent-in little finger. Ned replied
with the full salute, which is made with the hand
in the same attitude, only at the forehead.
</p>
<p>
“What does the badge say?” demanded
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Be prepared!” was the quick reply.
</p>
<p>
“For what?” was the next question.
</p>
<p>
“To assist those in distress.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re all right,” Jimmie shouted. “What
patrol?”
</p>
<p>
“Chanticleer, Denver,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“That accounts for the way you lighted
down from the mountain,” laughed Ned.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got used to climbing in walking the
streets of my home town,” smiled the other. “Is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
Ned Nestor here?” he added. “My name is
Ernest Whipple; I’m looking for Mr. Ned Nestor.”
</p>
<p>
“Here he is, the only good-looker in the
bunch,” Jack laughed, pushing Ned forward.
“What do you want of him?”
</p>
<p>
“My father is connected with the Secret
Service at Washington,” was the reply, “and
he posted me as to what was going on here.
Said I might come out and join the party, if
Mr. Nestor would permit it. What do you say?”
</p>
<p>
Of course the son of a man connected with
the Secret Service at Washington—a man who
undoubtedly knew all the plans of the men who
had sent Ned into the Northwest—was not to
be ignored, but at the same time Ernest would
have been received into the party on the strength
of his own engaging personality, his own frank
manner. From the very first moment he was
a favorite with all the boys.
</p>
<p>
“You’re as welcome as the flowers of May!”
Frank cried. “Been to supper?”
</p>
<p>
“Last night!” grinned Ernest. “My haversack
is empty—also my stomach. I had to
take to the mountain in order to keep out of the
fire, and couldn’t connect with a grub stake.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there are fires east of the divide?”
asked Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” was the reply, “although they are
nothing like the ones over here. The foresters
are watching them, and there is little danger
of their getting a big start.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did you find foresters?” asked Ned,
wondering if the men who had sneaked away
from the cavern were not posing as foresters
waiting to do further mischief.
</p>
<p>
“They are in camp beyond the summit,”
was the reply. “They told me they had patrols
all through the lower levels.”
</p>
<p>
Jack gave a description of the man who had
visited the camp on the plateau, and was not at
all surprised when Ernest identified the fellow
as the apparent leader of the band of foresters
he had passed on his way west.
</p>
<p>
“I see that you don’t believe the men are
foresters,” Ernest said, looking into Ned’s anxious
face. “Well, to tell the truth, I doubt it
myself. I heard some talk there that set me
thinking, after I got away. There was a man
there who had just arrived from San Francisco,
they said, and he was doing a good deal of kicking
about something that had been done, or
hadn’t been done. I don’t know which.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you describe the fellow?” asked Ned,
a quick suspicion coming to his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course I can,” was the reply, and the
remainder of the answer gave an accurate word
photograph of one Albert Lemon.
</p>
<p>
Ned was thinking fast. How had Lemon
reached the eastern side of the divide so quickly.
He, himself, had traveled swiftly from San Francisco,
leaving soon after his exit from the bachelor
apartment where the strange and not entirely
satisfactory interview had taken place.
He had left the man who claimed to be Albert
Lemon half dazed and weakened from the effects
of opium—still weary from a long and exhausting
journey, as shown by his clothing, and yet
the fellow had beaten him out in the race to the
mountains.
</p>
<p>
Why? Certainly not to take charge of the
body of his unfortunate friend, for the grave was
not there, but in a little hollow away to the
north and near the lake. His business seemed
to lie with the outlaws who had, apparently,
committed the crime. Why? Had the man
been killed as the result of a conspiracy between
the two interests?
</p>
<p>
This point was worth looking into, for the
motive for the deed might also prove to be the
motive for other crimes—among them the burning
of forests.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—CHASING THE MILKY WAY.</h2>
<p>
While the boys were exchanging experiences
with Ernest Whipple, talking over Boy Scout
matters and arranging for a sleeping place for
the stranger, Ned was busy with his aeroplane.
It had not suffered in the least from the heat
and wind, and there was plenty of gasoline on
hand for a journey which he was thinking of
taking.
</p>
<p>
“Where are we goin’ to-night?” Jimmie
asked, finally, strolling over to the spot where
the great bird lay.
</p>
<p>
“As the wind is right,” Ned laughed, “I
thought I’d take a sail over the divide and see
what the alleged foresters are up to.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” the boy said, “just wait until
I get a big blanket to wrap up in and I’ll go with
you.”
</p>
<p>
Ned smiled at the determination of the lad
to keep close to his side. He knew that Jimmie
dreaded the very idea of leaving the solid
earth that night, still he found him willing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
make the ascent merely for the sake of being in
his company.
</p>
<p>
“All right, kid,” he said. “You may go if
you want to, but it may be morning before we
get back to camp.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t remain in the air all that time,”
Jimmie said.
</p>
<p>
“I am fully aware of that,” Ned replied,
“but I can drop down over on the other side
and rest and tinker with the machine—if she
doesn’t work just right.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t got gasoline enough,” urged
Jimmie, who would have argued Ned out of the
notion of the night flight if possible, but who
was determined to go with him if he went.
</p>
<p>
“The first thing I do,” Ned replied, “will
be to fly over the Great Northern right of way
and fill up with gasoline. Besides filling the
tanks, I shall carry a lot away in an aluminum
keg I have provided for that purpose.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Jimmie said, with a tired sigh, “I
should think you’d been through enough to-day
and to-night, without goin’ off in the dark, but
I’m goin’ if you do.”
</p>
<p>
After talking with the others regarding his
intentions, and warning them to keep a sharp
lookout during his absence, Ned assisted Jimmie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
to his seat and the two were away. There was
scant room for a rise between the spot where the
machine lay and the foot of the range, but Ned
had little difficulty in getting into the sky and
swinging along in the breeze.
</p>
<p>
It was now after ten o’clock, and the moon
was high in the heavens. To the east the dark
passes of the mountains showed green and misty
in the moonlight. To the west the burned
spaces looked dark and forbidding, with smoke
half hiding the ruin that had been wrought.
Jimmie clung to the machine and insisted that
Ned was chasing the Milky Way when he lifted
the aeroplane up the level of the divide.
</p>
<p>
Before crossing the divide, however, Ned
flew to the Great Northern right of way and
filled his tanks with gasoline, also filling the
extra keg. The machine, which was an improved
Wright, was then turned to the north-east.
So perfect have aeroplanes now become
that even inexperienced drivers may sometimes
venture into the air with them with impunity,
still it is well known that it is more the man than
the machine that decides whether there shall be
a tumble or a successful flight.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane is a wonderful invention, yet
the point which really makes it so serviceable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
is a very simple one. For years inventors studied
ways of making a heavier-than-air machine
sail through the sky like a bird. Then the gasoline
engine came, and all the rest seemed easy.
</p>
<p>
But no one could keep control of the aeroplane.
It moved about according to its own
whims, and tipped drivers out at its own sweet
will. Then the Wrights thought of lifting and
lowering the planes to represent the wings and
feathers of a bird. The secret had been found
and required only experience and practice. Here
was a machine light enough to fly, yet strong
enough to carry with safety its powerful engine
and two or more passengers, if there is room
provided for them.
</p>
<p>
It is so stout that a man may walk over it
while it lies on the ground, and yet so delicate
in control when in the air that a slight pull on
a lever will dip one wing, lift the other, and at
the same time turn a vertical tail-rudder about
to give the necessary balancing pull with almost
the instinctive adaptability of a bird’s wings and
feathers.
</p>
<p>
And this wonderful machine, while speeding
through the air with the velocity of an express
train, can be halted almost instantly and whirled
about on its tail. It will be seen that it is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
man at the levers who makes or breaks a journey
in the air. One man may do almost anything
with a machine, while another may send
himself to eternity with the same one. It was
Ned’s good fortune that he was naturally ingenious
and quick to make his hands follow the
impulses of his brain.
</p>
<p>
When a person is thundering through the
air, a thousand feet above the earth, he must
remain perfectly calm, even with the engine
thundering behind his ears, tears running in
streams down his face, and the wind fluttering
his clothes into rags and ravelings, as he wishes
he was back on land.
</p>
<p>
Besides, there are no level plains in the air,
as there are on earth. Every bird-man knows
that he is liable to come up against a fierce current
or tumble into a hole in the atmosphere
at any moment. While traveling in water one
can see what is ahead and on both sides, but
this is not so in the air. The currents, swirls,
eddies, holes, do not show at all.
</p>
<p>
When Ned left the caché where the gasoline
and provisions had been hidden away, he put on
half speed, swinging steadily skyward on a broad
spiral. His purpose was to pass over the summit
and have a look at the forests on the east side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
The passenger’s seat in the Wright machine
is in the middle. The engine is at his right and
the driver at his left, so that the balance is the
same whether an extra person is carried or not.
Jimmie was glad of this, for it placed him close
to Ned. In that half light, with the earth far
below, with the pounding of the engine and the
whistling of the wind, the boy felt the need of
close human companionship.
</p>
<p>
He sat in a wooden seat with his back against
the rest, holding to one of the uprights with both
hands, and resting his tingling feet on a cross-bar.
A guy-wire passed across in front, close
to his chest, so he was now fastened in.
</p>
<p>
He wanted to talk with Ned, to hear the
sound of his voice, but the clamor of the engine
prevented that, so he just sat still and looked
down on the flying forest below. It seemed to
him, at least, that the forest was moving, while
he was standing still in the starlight.
</p>
<p>
Up the aeroplane went, and still higher up.
Jimmie saw the great divide below, and saw
little red specks in the forests of the eastern slope
which denoted forest fires not yet grown to
maturity. After passing the summit Ned saw
the campfire of the men Ernest had spoken of.
He passed them, swung around a circle lower
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
down, selected a spot where he thought he could
land with safety, and dropped down.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie declared afterwards that he felt as
if he had been thrown out of the window of a
twenty-story building—and the highest window
at that. When the aeroplane came into the
shadows of the high trees where the landing was
being made he knew that a wind was blowing at
the surface and feared that the machine would
be carried along on the ground and dumped over
into a cañon.
</p>
<p>
The machine sank gracefully into a glade
rather high up on the slope, and the boys alighted
to stretch their legs. Ned’s first move was to
see if there was plenty of room for him to get
out. What he found was an incline to the east,
an incline ending at a great cañon, into which
he would have been hurled had the aeroplane
run fifty feet farther on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“I think I can make it,” he said, “but it is
risky. It wouldn’t be nice to take a header a
thousand feet down.”
</p>
<p>
After the inspection of the locality Ned extinguished
all the lights and sat down to map
out his plans for the remainder of the night.
There were the usual noises of the forest, as
found at night, but no human sounds intruded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
Ned knew that the clamor of the engine must
have been heard by the men in the camp he had
flown over, and he had no doubt that the outlaws
would make a quick excursion to his landing
place, if they could determine where it was. So
he put out the lights and listened for some indication
of the approach of the others.
</p>
<p>
“They won’t find us in a thousand years,”
Jimmie volunteered, as the two sat close together
under a great tree.
</p>
<p>
“I hope not,” Ned replied, “for then we
shall have a better chance to find them.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you want to find ’em for?” questioned
the boy. “You can’t pinch ’em, ’cause
you haven’t got the proof, an’ you couldn’t if
you had the proof, ’cause there ain’t enough of
us. They’d eat us up like spinach.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right as far as you have gone,”
Ned replied, “but you have not gone far enough.
What I want now is to find out what they are
doing here. And, also, I want to find out about
that fellow from San Francisco. If the description
is any good, he was in the city when I left
it, and I don’t see how he ever got here so soon.
I came part way on an aeroplane, but it seems
that he traveled farther and beat me out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s he got to do with it?” asked Jimmie.
“What did you find out in the city? You won’t
have no luck if you don’t tell me all about it.”
</p>
<p>
So, while they waited, Ned told him “all
about it,” while the boy sat in the dusk with
his eyes and mouth both opened wide at the
mystery of the thing.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe Albert Lemon ever got out
here so soon,” the lad said, when the story was
told. “He couldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Then who is the man from San Francisco?”
asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be the dead man?” questioned
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“You saw him buried,” Ned answered.
</p>
<p>
“Then I give it up!” Jimmie said.
</p>
<p>
The two sat there in silence a long time, then
Jimmie gave Ned’s arm a pull and pointed to a
flickering light in the forest just above the glade
where the aeroplane rested.
</p>
<p>
“They think you’ve landed somewhere here,”
the boy said, “an’ have set fire to the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“I think you have guessed it,” Ned said.
“However, the blaze won’t run very fast up
there, for the undergrowth is scanty, so we’ve
got plenty of time to get out of the way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
Jimmie scrambled up the slope, clinging to
rocks and roots with both fingers and feet, and
ran toward the blaze. Ned watched the little
fellow dashing along with no little anxiety, for
the outlaws might be there in the thickets,
watching for some attempt to be made to lift
the aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
He saw Jimmie recklessly climb to the top of
a great rock which jutted out from the side of
the mountain and saw his figure outlined against
the growing blaze on the slope above. Then
the fire died down, as if for want of material,
and the top of the rock could no longer be seen.
</p>
<p>
Ned listened, but Jimmie did not return.
The effort to create a general conflagration on
the mountain side had evidently failed, for there
was little to burn save the green boles of trees,
that section having been swept by fire a year
before.
</p>
<p>
Not daring to leave the aeroplane for even an
instant, Ned awaited the return of the boy with
premonitions of trouble in his mind. Presently
he heard a shot, then a cry, and after that a
brutal laugh. The outlaws were nearer than he
thought.
</p>
<p>
There was only one thing for Ned to do,
and that was to get the aeroplane into the sky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
immediately, and so once more place it beyond
the reach of the outlaws. There was nothing he
could do to aid Jimmie, he reflected, sadly, by
remaining there.
</p>
<p>
It was no task at all to start the rollers down
the incline, but the cañon threatened if he did
not get it off the ground in quick time. He
knocked the stones out from under the wheels
and sprang into his seat. The machine, gaining
momentum, moved on sedately. It had
acquired a fair rate of speed when he came within
a few feet of the cañon.
</p>
<p>
Then, after letting it get all the headway
possible in that confined space without coming
too close to the cañon, Ned pulled the lever
which tilted the front rudder planes. Trifling
as the deflection was the man-made bird felt
its influence and rose from the slope as if endowed
with life.
</p>
<p>
It reached the edge of the descent some distance
in the air, and the boy was congratulating
himself on the success of his unaided rise when
the big machine began to sag as if dropping to
the ground, five hundred feet below.
</p>
<p>
The west wall of the cañon ran straight down,
and it seemed to Ned that he was following it,
like an iron spike thrown off the ledge. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
knew very well what had occurred. He had
fallen into one of the down-tipping currents so
frequent in mountain districts.
</p>
<p>
The air, he knew, was sliding down the precipice
just as water tumbles over a dam. If it
turned, as it might, when it struck the lower
strata of air, he might secure control of his machine
and manage to lift it out of the cañon. If
it did not, he would doubtless fall to the rocky
floor of the cañon, and lie there until some
chance hunter or forester came upon a heap of
bleaching bones and the wreck of an aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
But even at that swift pace downward, and
at that exciting moment, Ned found himself
puzzling over the strange sight he saw in a break
in the wall of the cañon. It was a large opening
he looked into, and strange figures were gathered
about a cooking fire.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—THE LUCK OF A BOWERY BOY.</h2>
<p>
Jimmie opened his eyes and looked about.
It was a gloomy niche in a perpendicular wall
that he looked out of. Rock to right and left
and rear. In front a velvet summer sky, with
stars winking over a vast stretch of broken
country. There was a ledge a foot in width
outside the entrance to the niche, but the boy
could not see how long it was, or where it led to.
</p>
<p>
His head ached and there was a drawing
sensation to the skin of his forehead and right
cheek, as if some sticky substance had congealed
there. When he reached a hand up to see what
the trouble was he found that his head was tied
up in a cloth. There was no one in sight to ask
questions of, so he arose to a sitting position
and leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
The action brought on a whirl of dizziness,
and he dropped back against the wall for support.
He knew then that he had received a hard
blow on the head, and that he had lost considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
blood. Once before in his life he had felt
that dizzy weakness, and that was after an artery
had been cut in his leg and he had nearly
bled to death before reaching a hospital.
</p>
<p>
When he lay back trying to get something
like a balance in his brain, he saw that it was
near midnight. He knew that by the stars, for
he had watched them many a hot night, lying
on his back on a dray backed up some alley
down near the East river, in New York.
</p>
<p>
There were certain stars which always occupied
just such a position at midnight in New
York. He did not know their names, but he
knew that at midnight in Montana they would
not be so far advanced across the sky. Therefore
he looked for the stars as they appeared at
nine o’clock on the Atlantic. When he found
them he knew from their location that it had
been something over an hour since he had left
Ned and the aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
The three hours difference in time between
New York and Montana—three hours in round
numbers—would make the midnight stars three
hours late, of course. Anyway, the boy was
pretty certain of the time.
</p>
<p>
Then his mind went back to Ned and the
aeroplane, and the cañon in front of the landing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
place. He recalled the stop, and remembered
leaving Ned to see what was doing in the way
of forest fires. He remembered, too, getting up
on a high rock to look over at the creeping flames.
</p>
<p>
But strange to say he did not remember getting
down again. The next thing on the record
of his mind was that niche in the wall and the
stars shining down out of a summer sky, the
same stars he had looked at in old New York.
Of course he had been struck the blow he had
received while mounting the rock, otherwise he
would know something of the attack.
</p>
<p>
His mind did not have to travel along the
records of the past very far to convince him that
he had made a mistake in leaving Ned. Of
course he had been “geezled” by the outlaws,
as he expressed it, and of course the boys would
delay the business they were on in order to look
him up—which, he reluctantly admitted to himself,
would be a waste of time, as any boy capable
of doing such foolish stunts certainly was
not worth the trouble of looking up.
</p>
<p>
Presently the pain in his head became less
violent and the dizziness in a measure passed
away. Then he pushed out to the edge of the
ledge and sat with his feet hanging over. It
was a straight drop down. Below he could see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
a stream of water running along the bottom of
the cañon.
</p>
<p>
Out, perhaps two hundred yards from his resting
place, he saw a slope half covered with trees.
He looked down into the gulf in the hope of seeing
the aeroplane, but it was not in sight. Ned
must have taken it away. Or he might have
been overpowered and the machine broken up.
</p>
<p>
Of course the outlaws would break up the
machine if they secured possession of it. They
would not dare use it in that region, and it was
about as handy a thing to ship away secretly
as a white elephant.
</p>
<p>
There were no lights in sight anywhere, save
a slight glow of coals away down at the bottom
of the cañon. That might be the remains of
the aeroplane, or it might be a bit of forest fire
which had not burned itself out. Very much
disgusted with himself, the boy leaned farther
out wondering if there wasn’t a ledge which
wound its way to the bottom of the cañon, or
to the summit above.
</p>
<p>
So intently was he studying on this proposition
that he did not hear footsteps approaching,
nor did he realize that there was any human
being near him until he felt a hand laid lightly
on his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, young man,” the voice said,
“or you’ll get another tumble. How do you
feel by this time?”
</p>
<p>
“Fine!” cried the boy, turning a pair of
astonished eyes toward the south, where a bulky
personage stood blocking the ledge to the extent
of obscuration.
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t take any more chances, then,”
said the bulky person, and Jimmie was forced,
not ungently, back into the niche.
</p>
<p>
The man entered after the boy and threw
himself down on the stone floor of the cut in the
wall of the cañon. He was short and stout,
with a double chin and a pointed forehead which
gave his face the appearance of being engraved
on a lemon. He was quite bald, and his hair,
that which remained, was turning gray. His
eyes were steel blue, and his mouth one long,
thin-lipped slit between fat cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did not like his looks at all, and he
resented the patronizing voice and manner. So
he leaned sullenly against the wall and waited for
the other to open the conversation. He had not
long to wait, for the man was busy in a moment.
</p>
<p>
“How did you get that fall?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
So, Jimmie thought, they were going to claim
that he had a fall, and that they had found him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
and cared for him gently, and were now ready
to do anything in the world for his comfort.
The boy decided that the correct course for him
to pursue was to follow the lead of the other.
</p>
<p>
“Guess I slipped off a rock,” he said, knowing
very well that he had been knocked off his
feet so suddenly that he had instantly lost consciousness.
</p>
<p>
“What were you doing there?” was the next
question.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I had been out in the aeroplane, and
I got out to see if the forest fire I saw was going
to be anything serious, and then I tumbled.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the boy who was with you in the
aeroplane?” asked the other.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie replied that he had no idea, which
was, of course, the answer expected of him. His
questioner remained silent a moment, looking
out over the rugged land to the east. When he
spoke again it was to ask:
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing in the Rocky Mountains?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie thought that was a cheeky question,
and a useless one, for he had no doubt that the
fellow knew nearly as much about his business
as he did about his own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’re on a vacation,” he replied. “Five
of us have a camp over on the other side of the
divide. We’re just playing prospectors.”
</p>
<p>
“Very nice vacation for you all,” the other
said, “but you ought to be more careful with
your fires. You started a large conflagration
yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
So the Boy Scouts were to be accused of that!
Jimmie wished at that moment that the other
boys were there. He wanted to tell this fat
hypocrite what he thought of him and stand a
fair show in the fracas which might follow.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think we set any fires,” he said.
“The fires started a long way from our camp.”
</p>
<p>
“I know what I’m talking about,” the other
said.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did not reply. He was wondering
what would be the next move of the fat party,
and whether Ned or the boys left in camp would
be out to look him up before the morning.
</p>
<p>
“I am in charge of this district,” the other
went on. “I’m Captain Slocum of the forestry
force.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did not believe it, but did not say so.
He only stared at the other in a manner which
nettled his dignity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have been watching you boys ever since
you have been here,” Captain Slocum went on.
“I didn’t know what you were up to, and so I
watched.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said Jimmie, quite humbly,
though angry enough to fight the man single-handed.
</p>
<p>
“It seems that you have left forest fires
wherever you have camped,” Slocum went on,
with an all-knowing air. “To-night I sent a
party of foresters over to the camp to arrest you
all.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Jimmie again, shutting
his lips hard in order to prevent saying a great
deal more.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think they will find this Ned Nestor
there?” Slocum asked, then.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether he could get his machine
back to the camp,” Jimmie replied.
</p>
<p>
“Well, wouldn’t he go without it?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; I don’t think he would, unless it
was certain that he could not take it with him.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find him, anyway,” Slocum continued.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you goin’ to take us for trial?”
Jimmie asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to consider that part of the matter
later on,” was the reply. “The first thing
for us to do is to lock you up good and tight and
stop the setting of forest fires.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Jimmie, still humbly, but
still thinking what he would do to this fat falsifier
if he ever got a chance.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you confess,” Slocum said.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t,” said Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, you did,” insisted the other.
“You admitted setting the fires.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie made no reply. Far down in the
cañon he saw a glint of flame. It was not a forest
fire. It was not even the red light of a campfire
or a lantern. The light was white, and the
boy knew it for what it was—an electric searchlight,
such as Ned always carried on his aeroplane
trips.
</p>
<p>
Slocum did not seem to see the light. His
eyes were fixed on the face of the boy he was
talking with, although the features did not show
very distinctly in the dim light of the night.
</p>
<p>
“Well, to tell you the truth, we’ve already
captured this Ned Nestor,” Slocum added, maliciously,
Jimmie thought, “and no doubt my
men have also captured those at the camp.
Nestor broke a leg in trying to get away, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
when he was fairly cornered he confessed everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” answered Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing else the boy could say
without putting himself in the way of a beating.
If he had expressed his opinion of this story no
doubt he would have been given physical punishment
for his frankness.
</p>
<p>
“And so,” Slocum smiled, “you may as well
continue the confession you began.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie recognized this as clumsy work in
the third degree, but he did not say so. He
was watching the light below. Now it disappeared
behind a great rock or tree. Now it
came out in the opening again and moved about
in a circle.
</p>
<p>
“Ned is examining his ’plane, preparatory to
going back to camp,” the boy thought. “Wonder
if he’s been all this time lookin’ for me?”
</p>
<p>
The boy paid little attention to what Slocum
said after this. Most of the time he was
looking into the sky, or anywhere rather than
where his thoughts were fixed. He had no intention
of directing the gaze of the alleged forester
to what was going on in the cañon.
</p>
<p>
Directly he saw the flashlight flutter over
the white planes then become stationary. Ned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
he knew, was getting ready to make a flight. He
could imagine what the boy’s feelings were, for
he knew Ned’s affection for him. Indeed, it
was with a heavy heart that the patrol leader
left the place without Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“And there is also a suspicion that you
boys are interested in getting opium over the
border without settling with Uncle Sam,” Jimmie
heard Slocum saying, as he watched the
aeroplane move forward, lift for a moment, and
then drop down out of sight. He knew of the
precipice just ahead of the machine, and trembled
for fear that Ned had not been able to lift the
aeroplane, but had tumbled into the cañon with
it.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Slocum continued, “we shall
place you under arrest for setting fire to the
woods and also for smuggling.”
</p>
<p>
Just at that moment Jimmie was not at all
interested in what Slocum was saying to him.
He took no interest whatever in any threat
made by the fellow. He was watching the
cañon for some sign of the reappearance of the
aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
After what seemed an eternity to the lad he
saw the light again, this time higher up than before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
It was lifting slowly, turning round and
round in a spiral, and Jimmie knew that there
was no room to mount into the sky in a straight
line. Ned’s control of the machine was wonderful,
and it lifted gradually until it was above
the line of the hills on the other side and shot
away to the west.
</p>
<p>
Then Slocum saw it. Jimmie blamed himself
for calling his attention to it by lifting his
head to follow the flight across the sky.
</p>
<p>
“There is another aeroplane,” Slocum said.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie could not restrain a laugh, which
intruded oddly enough on the tense silence of
the moment.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t think it is Nestor, do you?”
Slocum asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Jimmie, still humbly.
</p>
<p>
“But he must have taken a drop down the
cañon,” urged Slocum.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Jimmie, “but you said
you had captured him!”
</p>
<p>
Slocum eyed the boy with rage in his eyes.
He knew very well that while he had been telling
of Ned’s capture and confession, Jimmie
had been watching his chum get his aeroplane
out of the cañon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t even thanked me for getting
you out of the mess I found you in, and doctoring
up your wound,” he said, presently, resolved
to keep on good terms with the boy for a short
time longer, if it was possible to do so.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir!” Jimmie said, very modestly.
“I think I must have received a good
bump on the head.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed you did,” smiled the other.
</p>
<p>
After a little further talk Slocum led the boy
away to a cavern in the wall of the cañon which
seemed to the weary lad to have no end. He
saw several people lounging about as he passed
through a large chamber, but paid little attention
to them.
</p>
<p>
At last Slocum halted in a little alcove opening
from a second chamber, in which were assembled
at least a score of Chinamen.
</p>
<p>
“These people won’t harm you,” he said to
the boy, swinging his arm about to include the
group. “Uncle Sam is trying them out in the
forest service, I don’t think much of the idea
myself, but I’m not the boss.”
</p>
<p>
Then Slocum went away and Jimmie lay
down and watched the Chinamen. Listening,
he heard one of them speaking in English, then
in Chinese. He knew that he had heard that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
peculiar voice and dialect before and devoted
his whole attention to the fellow.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he muttered, in a moment, with a
grin, “I’m havin’ the luck of a Bowery boy in
this deal, an’ that is the greatest luck in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
Then he fell to wondering what Chang Chee,
the keeper of one of the worst Chinese restaurants
on Doyers street was doing there, in the
heart of the Rocky Mountains, mixed up with
alleged foresters.
</p>
<p>
“Just wait until I see Ned!” the boy mused.
“I’ll put him next to somethin’. He’ll be glad
he brought me with him!”
</p>
<p>
Then the boy’s thoughts went back to the
camp in the Valley of the Wild Beasts, as he
called it. Slocum might have told the truth
about the attack on the boys, and they might
be in trouble at that moment. He wondered,
too, if, in case they were taken prisoners, they
would be brought to the cavern.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” the lad mused, “they never
intend to let me get out of this. If they did,
they wouldn’t have permitted me a sight of the
Chinks. Unless I sneak away, there’ll be an
accident some day, an’ then there’ll be no more
Jimmie McGraw!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
The boy was tired and weak, so that even
such serious thoughts as these could not keep
him awake. Wondering what conditions Ned
had found at the camp, after soaring out of the
cañon, he dropped his head against the stone
wall of the alcove and was soon in a deep sleep.
The fumes of opium with which the cavern was
filled might in a measure have contributed to
this, but, anyway, nature was exhausted, and
the boy’s slumber was heavy and dreamless.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—A MEMBER OF THE OWL PATROL.</h2>
<p>
When Jimmie awoke the fire which had
burned in the cavern had gone out, and those
who remained in the chamber seemed to be fast
asleep. He tumbled out of his alcove, still feeling
weak and dizzy, and moved toward a hanging
rug which closed the entrance to the place.
</p>
<p>
He drew one side of the rug back and saw
the white light of day. The sun seemed to be
high up in the sky, for the ledge at the front of
the cavern showed a streak of gold. Two Chinamen
sat at the entrance to the outer cave, and
when he advanced toward them they waved
him back. Instead of retreating he stood regarding
them with a puzzled look on his face.
</p>
<p>
One was Chang Chee, the keeper of the disreputable
Chinese dive on Doyers street, whom
Jimmie had noticed the night before, and the
other was a much younger man—a boy, in fact.
When Chang ordered Jimmie back the youngster
turned toward him a face showing both curiosity
and interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s doin’ here?” Jimmie demanded, in
a moment.
</p>
<p>
He thought best not to show that he recognized
Chang, for he knew that the identification
of the Chinaman would only add to his peril, if
that were possible. It was certain that Chang
would never permit the information that he had
been seen there to get out to the government
officers.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie’s idea at that time was that he had
blundered on a gang of opium smugglers, although
he could not understand why so many
Chinamen were, apparently, engaged in the illegal
traffic.
</p>
<p>
Chang finally turned his face away, with a
frown, and Jimmie advanced a step toward the
boy, who threw himself carelessly down on his
back and extended his right arm straight up
from the shoulder. Jimmie’s eyes opened wider,
and his breath almost stopped, when he saw the
thumb and little finger thrown diagonally across
the palm of the hand, the tip of the thumb covering
the nail of the little finger, the three remaining
fingers pointing upward.
</p>
<p>
In the excitement of the moment, in the
amazement caused by his recognition of the
Boy Scout challenge, Jimmie lost all caution.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say!” he began, but Chang turned a repulsive
face and ordered him into the rear
chamber.
</p>
<p>
The boy, thankful for the interruption,
moved back a few paces, believing that the
Chinese boy who had given him the sign would
communicate with him as soon as opportunity
offered.
</p>
<p>
This was the greatest puzzle the lad had ever
been called upon to solve. Some of the questions
he asked himself were:
</p>
<p>
“How did that Chinese boy become a Boy
Scout?”
</p>
<p>
“Is there a Chinese patrol?”
</p>
<p>
“Was he permitted to become a member of
an American patrol?”
</p>
<p>
“Why is he mixed up with that disreputable
old Chink?”
</p>
<p>
“Will he help me out of this hole, or will he
ignore me?”
</p>
<p>
Of course there was not one of the questions
the boy could answer, so he went back to his
alcove and sat down, half believing that he had
imagined the challenge.
</p>
<p>
As the day wore on the men who had been
asleep in the inner chamber arose, staggeringly,
as if still under the stupefying influence of opium,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
and made their trembling way outside.
When they had all disappeared Chang pushed
the rug aside so as to bring more light and air
into the place and came and stood looking down
on the boy.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did not look up. He saw the shrunken
figure up as far as the knees only. He was
resolved not to open any conversation with the
Chink. If he wanted to talk, Jimmie thought,
let him choose his own subject and introduce
it in his own way.
</p>
<p>
The yellow face of the Chinaman seemed to
take on a more mask-like expression—or want
of expression, rather—as the silence continued.
When he spoke it was with a snarl which boded
no good to the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Hungly?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Hungry?” repeated Jimmie. “You know
it! If you’ve got any rat sandwiches or puppy
potpies, just introduce me!”
</p>
<p>
“Flesh!” growled Chang.
</p>
<p>
“Flesh?” repeated Jimmie. “Oh, yes, you
mean fresh? Well, you’d be just as fresh as I
am if you were as hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“Cheek!” cried Chang. “Kid allels have
cheek—an’ tummy!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” said Jimmie. “Go on an’ get me
a porterhouse steak with French potatoes. I
could eat a car of raw onions.”
</p>
<p>
Chang turned away and walked out to the
ledge, where the Chinese boy stood, looking out
into the sunshine. It was a glorious morning,
with the air clear and just a little sharp, owing
to the altitude. Here and there little swirls of
smoke showed that fires were burning in the
forest, though none seemed to be close to the
range.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the boy’s side Chang addressed a
few words to him in Chinese and left the cave,
turning back, after a few paces, to observe the
boy, now standing with a long, keen-bladed
clasp-knife in his hand. As Chang looked the
boy ran his finger over the edge of the blade, as
if to make sure that it was suitable for some purpose
he had in view.
</p>
<p>
With an exclamation of rage Chang charged
back at him and snatched the knife from his
hand.
</p>
<p>
“You fool!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“You let me alone!” shouted the other. “I
tell you, I’m going to kill him!”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie heard the words and rose unsteadily
to his feet. He recognized the voice as that of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
the boy who had given him the Boy Scout challenge.
At least it was not that of Chang, and
there were only two figures outlined against the
sky when he looked out beyond the rug, still
pushed aside.
</p>
<p>
“Fool! Fool! Fool!”
</p>
<p>
Chang gritted out the words as he took the
Chinese boy by the back of the neck and hustled
him into the cave. Then he spoke for a
minute in Chinese and turned away again.
Jimmie stepped back into his alcove and felt
around for a stone, or anything in the shape of a
weapon, as the boy advanced toward him.
</p>
<p>
“What does the badge say?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie opened his eyes wider than ever, if
possible, and stood facing the boy, half hiding
the stone he had found.
</p>
<p>
“Be prepared,” he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Then drop that rock!”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie dropped it and stepped forward.
</p>
<p>
“Liu, Owl patrol, San Francisco,” the Chinese
boy said.
</p>
<p>
“McGraw, Wolf patrol, New York,” replied
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t look very comfortable in here,”
Liu said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nixy,” replied Jimmie, wondering if the
boy really was preparing to carry out the threat
he had made to Chang.
</p>
<p>
“You heard what I just said to Chang?”
Liu asked.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie nodded his bandaged head.
</p>
<p>
“Bluff!” said Liu. “He’s watching now to
see that I don’t make an attempt on your life.
Had to do it!”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” Jimmie replied, wondering if it
wasn’t pretty near time to wake up.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t he want me killed?” Jimmie
asked in a moment.
</p>
<p>
“He thinks you have information he needs,”
was the answer. “Are you hungry?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what Chang asked,” Jimmie said,
“but he didn’t bring me any grub.”
</p>
<p>
“He told me to,” grinned Liu, “and I told
him that I’d kill you if I got near enough to
do so. He’ll hang around until he sees me
bring you something to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t so very slow yourself,” grinned
Jimmie. “Where did you learn to speak United
States so well?”
</p>
<p>
“Born in Frisco,” was the reply. “The
Boy Scouts take me out on their hunting trips
to do the cooking. That’s why I’m here now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
I know the mountains, and Chang hired me to
go along with him.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ they took you into the patrol, did
they?” asked Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Sure they did,” was the reply. “Why
not? I’m an American citizen, or will be in
four years.”
</p>
<p>
“Have they captured any of the others?”
asked Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese boy shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Have they heard from the men they sent
out to capture them?” was the next question.
</p>
<p>
Another shake of the head, then Liu drew
closer and whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Do you see Chang poking his head around
that rock in the opening? He’s watching to see
that I don’t knife you!”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie saw the parchment-like face of the
old reprobate peering around the rock and
wanted to heave a stone at it, but knew that
this would not be good policy. Instead he
threw it at Liu, and missed, of course.
</p>
<p>
“You seem to be wide awake yourself,” Liu
said.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you go and get me some grub?”
demanded Jimmie. “I’m near starved to death.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“All right!” said Liu, and turned away.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie was now in a deeper puzzle than
before. He had no means of knowing whether
Liu was telling him the truth. He might be
trying to get into his confidence in order to gain
the information sought, whatever it was.
</p>
<p>
However, in a short time Liu returned with
a generous supply of food, fried fish, fresh biscuit—the
boy wondered how Liu had managed
to bake them there—coffee, and plenty of tinned
goods.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this bunch doin’ here?” the boy
asked, as he made heavy inroads on the fresh
fish, coffee and biscuits.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” was the hesitating reply.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” Jimmie went on. “They’re
smuggling opium an’ setting fire to the woods.
They’ll all get pinched!”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“It sounds odd to hear a Chinese boy talk
straight United States,” Jimmie said, after a
short silence.
</p>
<p>
Liu made no reply for a moment. He was
watching the ledge outside the entrance to the
cave. The occasional rattle of pebbles told
him that some one was standing there, probably
just out of sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is Chang doin’ here?” Jimmie asked,
presently.
</p>
<p>
“He’s in some scheme with the foresters,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“They ain’t no foresters!” Jimmie said.
“They’re timber thieves an’ smugglers, an’
firebugs, an’ murderers!”
</p>
<p>
Liu shuddered but remained silent. After
listening a second he went to the entrance and
looked out. There was no one in sight at first,
then a roughly dressed fellow came around the
angle of the cliff to the north and approached
him. The fellow was rather short for a man of
his width of shoulder, and his step was remarkably
light and quick for one of his apparent
weight.
</p>
<p>
His face was sun and wind-tanned, with
plenty of mountain soil on top of that. A cartridge-belt
encircled the loose jacket he wore and
a revolver handle protruded from the pistol
pocket of his trousers.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the word?” he asked, gruffly, as
he came up to Liu.
</p>
<p>
“Go on in,” replied Liu.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie saw evidences of treachery in the
hostile attitude of the newcomer and retreated
farther into the cavern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
Then he saw Liu doubling up with laughter
and stopped. It didn’t look very amusing to
him, especially as the stranger was advancing
toward him with swift strides. Then something
remotely familiar in the set of the shoulders,
the carriage of the head, attracted his
closer attention to the figure and he moved forward
a step.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a nice little boy to get into a trap
like this!”
</p>
<p>
There was no mistaking that voice. Just
how Ned Nestor had secured that disguise and
found his way to that spot Jimmie did not stop
to think. He knew that it was his chum, and
that was enough. While the two boys clasped
hands Liu stood regarding them smilingly, at
the same time watching the entrance.
</p>
<p>
“How did you ever find this hole?” Jimmie
asked, his wonder at the thing which had happened
mastering all else.
</p>
<p>
“I saw this cave when my machine dropped
into a hole in the air in the cañon,” was the
reply. “The shelf where we landed is just
above this cavern. There was a fire in the outer
room, and numerous Chinamen were moving
about.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’re opium smugglers,” Jimmie said.
</p>
<p>
“Man smugglers!” laughed Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean that they bring Chinks over
the border here, an’ so run them down into
civilization whenever they get a chance?” demanded
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“That is just it,” Ned answered. “We
seem to have come upon a lot of the articles
to be smuggled,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“How did you come across Liu?” Jimmie
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I met him while I was prowling about
not far from the cave, at daylight,” was the
reply. “He helped me get this disguise.”
</p>
<p>
Liu was still watching at the mouth of the
cavern, so the boys talked freely, with little fear
of being disturbed. Ned told of his return to
the camp, and of the all-night hunt for the missing
boy. It took Ned and Frank a long time
to find the opening the former had seen in his
swift drop down the cañon, but about daylight
it was located.
</p>
<p>
They had, however, found many Chinamen
loitering about, and Frank had gone back to
camp to reassure the others, while Ned remained
on the eastern side on the chance of getting into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
communication with Jimmie. While loitering
about Liu had come up the slope.
</p>
<p>
It was quite a long story, that of his getting
a perfect understanding with Liu, and Ned cut
it as short as possible, merely saying that Liu
had recognized his name, having heard his associates
mention it frequently. Then the Chinese
boy had procured the disguise and Ned had
stuffed out the shoulders of the coat to give it a
better fit.
</p>
<p>
“I was observed by a half a dozen men, some
Americans, some Chinamen, while getting in
here,” Ned said, then, “but the disguise misled
them. Now, the question is this: How are we
going to get out?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to fight our way out?” asked
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t answer,” Ned replied. “They
are too many for us.”
</p>
<p>
Liu now came into the second cave and held
up his hand for silence.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to hide in the back chamber,”
he said. “Chang is coming in.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought this was the back chamber,”
Jimmie said.
</p>
<p>
“I suspect,” Liu said, “that there’s a chain
of caves running through the divide. Come on!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
Liu passed back to the west, removed a
great box which stood against the rear wall, and
disclosed an opening through which the patrol
leader crawled. When the box was replaced
Ned stopped and listened. What he heard was
the click of a typewriter.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—OFF ON A DESPERATE MISSION.</h2>
<p>
What business calling for the use of a typewriter
was being transacted under the main
divide of the Rocky Mountains?
</p>
<p>
Ned stood perfectly still in the darkness and
listened. He could hear the click of the keys
and nothing else. At length he moved stealthily
forward over an even surface, feeling his way
in order that he might not trip over some unseen
obstruction and raise a racket in a tumble.
</p>
<p>
Presently he came to a rug hanging at the
end of the chamber in which he was. From the
other side of the rug came a faint light. The
noise of the keys was more distinct here, and
the boy knew that he had at least located the
operator.
</p>
<p>
While he stood listening and undecided as
to what course to pursue, the noise of the machine
ceased and the operator—a young, well-dressed
American—came toward him carrying
a lighted candle in his hand. Ned crouched
down in an angle of the wall and waited for him
to pass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
The boy was not quite so anxious now to
leave the strange rendezvous in which he found
himself. Some mischief greater than smuggling
opium and Chinamen over the border might
be carried on there. His work seemed to be
growing on his hands!
</p>
<p>
He had been sent to that district to investigate
the cause of the frequent forest fires, and
given an aeroplane in order that he might fly
over the forests in making his observations.
It seemed to him now, as he lay on his side
against a wall of rock, waiting for the typist to
pass with his light, that he was spending more
time under the ground than in the air!
</p>
<p>
The main range of the Rocky Mountains in
the northern part of Montana is noted for its
rugged and irregular formation. It is declared
by some that the home of the original cave
dwellers was here. Many of the great cañons are
known to be honeycombed with openings almost
large enough to hide a small city in.
</p>
<p>
The typist moved straight ahead and his
light disappeared from view. Then Ned advanced
beyond the rug, which appeared to be
of fine material, and flashed on his light. There
was a table in the room, a couple of chairs, a
row of pigeon-holes attached to the wall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
On the table was a typewriter, in the pigeon-holes
were folded papers, neatly ticketed and
enclosed in rubber bands. Aside from the underground
smell the place was tolerably comfortable.
The air was damp and chilly, but Ned was well
clothed and did not mind that.
</p>
<p>
As has been said, the boy was now in no
haste to leave the place. He believed that the
mystery he had been sent out to solve would be
solved there. For an hour or more he searched
over the place, opening the folded papers and
making a close examination of the typewriter
and the stock of unused paper in the drawer of
the table.
</p>
<p>
At length, his examination completed, he
passed back into the chamber behind the rug
and listened at the opening through which he
had entered. A sound of the steady beat of
blows reached his ears at first, then a low
whistle. That was Jimmie, he knew. The lad
had a habit of whistling softly to himself, usually
without time or tune.
</p>
<p>
Waiting for a lull in the blows, he rapped
softly on the box which backed up against the
opening. Instantly the whistling ceased, and
Jimmie’s voice was heard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come on out,” the boy said. “I’ve been
kicking my heels against this box for an hour,
waitin’ for you to signal back.”
</p>
<p>
“Be sure there is no one watching,” Ned
cautioned.
</p>
<p>
He heard Jimmie walking away, then heard
him coming back. In a moment the box was
drawn away from the opening.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve been in there long enough to dig
through to China,” Jimmie said, as Ned stood
by his side. “What did you find in there?”
</p>
<p>
“A double keyboard typewriter,” grinned
Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Quit your kiddin’,” answered Jimmie.
“You’ll be claimin’ next that you found a brass
band in there.”
</p>
<p>
Ned did not stop to explain to the boy all
that he had discovered in the inner chamber.
His work there seemed to be finished now, and
he was anxious to get back to camp. There
was no knowing what had been going on there
during his absence.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Liu?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Watchin’ outside,” was the reply. “He’s
my guard. Goin’ to shoot me if I try to get
away.”
</p>
<p>
“And the others?” asked Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know,” replied Jimmie. “They
herded a lot of Chinks an’ went off down the
valley.”
</p>
<p>
Liu now appeared in the entrance, bowed
gravely to the boys, and stepped out on the
ledge, with a Boy Scout challenge in the wave
of his hand.
</p>
<p>
“He’s all right!” Jimmie said. “You ought
to see the breakfast he got up for me. That
feller can cook—an’ then some!”
</p>
<p>
“Call him,” Ned suggested, “and we’ll see
if it is safe for me to go out.”
</p>
<p>
“For you to go out!” repeated Jimmie.
“For us to go out.”
</p>
<p>
“I think you’d better remain here,” Ned
replied.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie looked at his chum in amazement.
The light back there was not good, but Ned
saw several questions in the boy’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Liu can protect you, can’t he?” Ned asked.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I don’t know,” was the reply.
“He will do his best, of course, but his best
might not be good enough.”
</p>
<p>
Ned was thinking fast. If he permitted the
boy to leave, the fact of his escape would be
likely to scatter the outlaws—and he very much
wished to keep them together for a short time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think,” he said, “that we have found
the men we want—with the goods. If you
leave now they will make a quick getaway.
You see that, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” was the reply. “An’ I see,
too, that if I remain I’m the one that’s likely
to make a quick getaway—to a country no one
comes back from.”
</p>
<p>
“There may be some other way,” Ned said,
thoughtfully. “Give me a chance to think it
over.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll stay, all right,” Jimmie went on,
“if it will do any good. I guess they won’t eat
me alive.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke the boy put his hand to his eyes
and gave them a long rub.
</p>
<p>
“There’s smoke in here,” he said. “Don’t
you smell it?”
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking of that,” Ned replied, anxiously.
“There may be a fire in the cañon.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless of consequences, Jimmie rushed
to the ledge and looked out. The sun was no
longer in sight, for a mist of smoke hung over
the cañon and over the slope to the east.
</p>
<p>
“There’s goin’ to be the biggest blaze ever!”
Jimmie cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
Liu came to the side of the boys and pointed
to the south.
</p>
<p>
“The fire came through a gully over there,”
he said. “I was watching it from here. It
was not put out yesterday, and worked its way
over the divide. When it gets to going strong
here no one can live in this cavern. I’m going
to get out.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the idea!” Jimmie cried.
</p>
<p>
The cañon was a veritable fire trap. For
years the boughs and the turp of the trees had
been dropping down. Ned knew that the blaze
would mount to the cavern and be drawn into
it. The atmosphere of the place indicated
openings at the rear which would serve as chimneys.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the devils!” Jimmie cried. “To set
a fire like that!”
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t set it, I tell you,” insisted Liu,
speaking as if in the defense of his employers.
</p>
<p>
“Who did, then?” demanded Jimmie, half
angrily.
</p>
<p>
“It came through from the other side, just
as I told you,” replied Liu, with the utmost
good nature. “There’ll be a pass through the
range some day where the fire found its way
through.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“But they set the fire on the other side,”
Jimmie urged. “They set it for the purpose of
burning our aeroplane an’ driving us out of the
district. When we go out of the district they’ll
go with us, wearin’ steel bracelets!” he added.
</p>
<p>
“I rather think,” Liu said, “that they set
the fires over there to draw the foresters, away
from this section, and so protect their business.
That is what they have been doing right along.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Ned said, “there has been a forest fire
for every cargo of opium, for every gang of Chinamen,
that has been brought in over the border.”
</p>
<p>
“So that is the real trouble?” asked Jimmie.
“How do you know so much about it?”
</p>
<p>
Ned smiled and pointed to the slope to the
east, where columns of fire were cutting their
way through the timber.
</p>
<p>
“It strikes me,” he said, “that now is a
pretty good time for us to get out of this. The
outlaws won’t come back so long as this danger
exists, and we shall not be missed for a long time—or
rather, Liu and Jimmie will not be missed.”
</p>
<p>
“They’ll think we ran out to escape the heat
and lost our lives in the fire,” Liu said.
</p>
<p>
Ned stood hesitatingly at the mouth of the
cavern while Liu gathered a few articles he
wanted to take with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“If I thought the fire would reach the cave
when the big trees in the cañon get to going,”
he mused, “I’d go back and get the papers—or
more of them.”
</p>
<p>
“It surely will get into the cave,” Liu said.
“You see, the summit scoops down here quite
a lot, and the timber line is almost to the top.
The gulch below is quite high up on this elevation,
still it is not so very high as compared
with some of the summits to the north and
south. So, you see, the timber line here is capable
of getting up a good deal of a blaze, especially
where the cañons are full of trees. The
fire will come up here, all right.”
</p>
<p>
Ned darted away, was gone a minute or so,
and returned with hands full of folded papers.
</p>
<p>
“What you got?” demanded Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
Ned laughed but made no satisfactory reply.
After stowing the papers away in the numerous
pockets of his borrowed suit, he led the way
down the ledge, away from the cave he had first
seen in his fall down the cañon, and which had
proved so profitable to his search.
</p>
<p>
The air was now filled with smoke. The
cañon below was not yet in full flame, but a
column of destruction was creeping upon it from
the south. It seemed to Ned that there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
numerous small fires, though how this could be
true he could not understand.
</p>
<p>
The boys made their way along the ledge
without coming upon any of the men who had
occupied the cavern. It was evident that the
few left after the departure of the men with the
Chinamen had fled before the clouds of smoke.
The ledge wound up on the plateau from which
Ned had dropped the night before, and here they
paused to decide on some course of action.
</p>
<p>
The light breeze was from the west, so the
fires below were in a measure protected from it
by the bulk of the summit, but Ned knew that
the heat would in time bring the air into the
burning spaces with a rush, merging the little
blazes into one gigantic one which might repeat
the disasters of August, 1910.
</p>
<p>
Now and then, from far to the east, there
came a signal in the shape of a gunshot. The
faithful foresters were at work there, trying to
head off the advancing flames before they passed
beyond control. The place to combat a forest
fire, of course, is ahead of it, and not where the
red line is running through the sputtering timber.
</p>
<p>
“If I could get the aeroplane,” Ned said, as
he looked over the country from the plateau, “I
might get to the fighting line and do some good.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where is it?” asked Liu.
</p>
<p>
“At the camp.”
</p>
<p>
“The others won’t dare bring it out, of
course?” asked Liu.
</p>
<p>
“Doubtful,” Ned replied. “Frank has always
taken a great interest in the machine, and
was studying its mechanism when I left, but I
don’t think he will attempt to operate it. He
ought not to, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“If the men who left here to pinch the boys,”
Jimmie said, “showed up at the camp, an’ Frank
got a chance to mount the aeroplane, you bet
your life he’s shootin’ through the air with it
this minute, or hidin’ in some valley.”
</p>
<p>
“But there were three of them,” Ned urged,
“and all couldn’t ride.”
</p>
<p>
“They’d try!” gritted Jimmie, “unless Pat
got cold feet an’ run away.”
</p>
<p>
Ned glanced up at the sky, now very thick
with smoke, as the boy spoke. He looked with
indifference at first, then with interest, then
with anxiety. There was a shape moving up
there, coming slowly toward the plateau.
</p>
<p>
“There they are!” shouted Jimmie, whose
attention had been attracted to the sky by Ned’s
fixed gaze. “Frank’s runnin’ the machine. I’ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
bet dollars to apples that he’ll dump her into
the cañon when he tries to land here.”
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane, indeed, looked as if there were
an uncertain hand at the helm. She wavered,
tipped in the air currents, dipped wickedly, circled
staggeringly, but finally swooped down
on the plateau and, more by good luck than
good handling, settled down within a dozen feet
of the lip of the cañon. Frank and Jack were
aboard. Pat, they said, had taken to his heels
at the first suggestion of his joining the others
in the ride.
</p>
<p>
Ned examined the machine carefully and
found it in excellent shape, although the gasoline
was getting low.
</p>
<p>
“Better go an’ get some,” Jimmie suggested.
</p>
<p>
Ned looked toward the line of smoke off to
the east.
</p>
<p>
“We can reach the firing line with what we
have,” he said, in a moment, “and that may be
sufficient for the present.”
</p>
<p>
“What you goin’ to do?” demanded the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Going to see if I can’t help fight this fire,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“From here?” laughed Jack.
</p>
<p>
Ned indicated a distant line of hills where
the forest still stood green on the slopes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll fight the fire from there,” he said.
“We can see the location well enough now, but
the smoke will soon shut it out from here.”
</p>
<p>
“What can we do when we get there?” asked
Jack. “We are safe enough here. The smoke
and heat may scorch us a little, but we’ll live
through it, and that is more than we can say
about the safety of the place you point out.”
</p>
<p>
“Pat will be making his way here,” Ned said,
“and you may as well remain here and meet
him. I’ll take Frank and go over to the place
where the foresters are fighting the blaze.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie was on his feet in an instant.
</p>
<p>
“Me for the ride with you!” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Some one may have to run the machine
back,” Ned said. “You can’t do that, my little
man, and Frank can, so Frank goes.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see what you can do over there that
the foresters can’t do,” Liu said.
</p>
<p>
“There is no knowing how useful the aeroplane
may be,” Ned said.
</p>
<p>
Then the machine was rolled back as far up
the plateau as possible, the boys took their seats,
and then they were lost in the dense clouds of
smoke in the sky.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—THE BATTLE IN THE AIR.</h2>
<p>
The smoke was driving fiercely through the
green trees on the slope, and the line of fire was
not far in the rear. Every moment the wind
gained force, every minute the flames leaped
higher and faster.
</p>
<p>
The foresters felling trees and clearing a
space at an advantageous point some distance
in advance of the flames were working blindly,
mechanically. The heat was intense, the smoke
suffocating, irritating, blinding. The shirts of
the workers were open at the throat, their coats
had long ago been lost as they had been beaten
back from one stand to another.
</p>
<p>
Now and then a worker dropped senseless
in his tracks, his lips cracked with the heat, his
face blistered, his tongue lolling from his smarting
mouth like that of an overworked horse.
Then the men who were able to move and understand
would carry him back to a spot of supposed
safety and return to re-engage in the almost
hopeless fight, the battle which the flames were
winning in every charge and sally.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane, after a narrow escape from
destruction, landed on a little rise of ground
back of the working line when the wind lulled
for an instant, and hope shone in the faces of
the astonished men who gathered about to greet
the unexpected arrivals.
</p>
<p>
“We can master it,” Green, the leader, said,
after many questions had been asked and answered,
“if we can be supplied with water. We
wasted our supply wetting our clothes a long
time ago, and are suffering.”
</p>
<p>
“Get us water,” shouted another, “and we’ll
win yet.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a spring three miles away,” Green
went on, speaking in Ned’s ear, for the roaring
of the flames drowned all ordinary conversation.
“If you can take our water bottles there and
fill them we can beat this blaze. If you can’t
we’ve got to retreat and let the whole district
burn over.”
</p>
<p>
“I have very little gasoline,” Ned replied,
“but I’ll try.”
</p>
<p>
“We sent two men out not long ago,” Green
continued, thrusting his scorched face close to
the boy’s. “We sent them out with water bags,
but there are no trails, and It will take them
hours to make the spring and return. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
your aeroplane you ought to do it within half
an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“Fire fighters marooned without a supply of
water, or a trail cut to a spring!” shouted Frank,
scornfully. “Great head some one in authority
has!”
</p>
<p>
“There are no trails, no telephones, no
horses!” cried Green. “It looks as if the government
sent us here to die. Hurry up with
that water.”
</p>
<p>
“If the gasoline holds out,” Ned said, loading
a dozen water bags on the machine, “I’ll be back
here in less than half an hour, bar accidents.”
</p>
<p>
“There is plenty of gasoline back there in
the shanty,” cried Green. “We have been
using it lately in starting back fires, but the wind
is now too strong for that. Get a move on, and
take all you want.”
</p>
<p>
In a short space of time, but not without
great risk, the tanks of the aeroplane were filled,
and then Ned took in the general situation in
the sky. The wind was blowing in puffs, but
it was certain that a miniature tornado was at
hand. He thought he could reach the spring,
which had been described as lying to the southeast,
but was not certain that he could make
his way back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
He believed, however, that by flying either
very low or very high up, so as to get all the protection
possible from the mountain, or escape
the sweep of wind just above the fire, he might
be able to bring in one load of water before the
worst of the wind storm came. He knew that
it was an almost unheard of thing to even try
to navigate the air in such a gale, but human
lives were at stake, and he decided to try.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to help me up against this
wind,” Ned said to Green. “If I start with the
air current I’ll be carried too far to the east before
my power begins to become effective. If
I can hold my own against the wind until I get
above the smoke I think I can win the game.”
</p>
<p>
It was a desperate expedient, but it appeared
to be the only possible one. If the men had
water they might succeed in stopping the fire
and saving millions of dollars worth of timber.
If the fire gained the upper hand they might
lose their lives. The men cleared and smoothed
a path for the run of the wheels, by great exertion
sent the machine along at good speed,
and then stood and watched it with anxiety
depicted in their faces.
</p>
<p>
The great white bird quivered in the face of
the wind, but the motors were true to their duty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
and the rudder held. To turn about in the face
of that rush would be impossible, so Ned worked
his levers guardedly and kept the wings as level
as he could. Now and then a swirl of heated
air would shake the hopes of those watching below,
but in the end the aeroplane drifted slowly
ahead, up, higher up, and was lost in the smoke.
</p>
<p>
“The lad is worth his weight in gold!”
shouted Green. “He’ll do it! I know he’ll do
it!”
</p>
<p>
“Powerful motor,” one of the foresters said.
“When we saw the machine last she was actually
holding her own against the wind.”
</p>
<p>
This was, indeed, the fact, but the wind was
not as strong in the higher levels as at the upper
limit of the heat from the fires. A great fire
usually brings a great wind, as those who witnessed
the burning of Chicago and San Francisco
well know. The hot air rises, forming a
partial vacuum, and the colder air rushes in.
</p>
<p>
Ned and Frank gained the spring, filled their
water bags and started back. It was no easy
task to land near the spring in that whirl of wind,
nor yet an easy task to get the aeroplane into
the air again, but the feats were accomplished.
Often after that exciting day the boys declared
that they had no idea how they ever did it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“We were excited,” Frank would say, “and
took chances, everything worked in our favor,
and we loaded the water. We knew that lives
were at stake, and it seemed that we had the
strength of a score of men, and the cool heads
of men far beyond all excitement. I never saw
anything like the way Ned handled the levers.
The wings and the rudders seemed to me to
work on a brain suggestion rather than on a
movement of the levers.”
</p>
<p>
But the most difficult part of the journey
still remained to be accomplished after the water
had been secured. The ’plane was much heavier
and did not respond so readily to the hand
of the driver, and the return course was quartering
against the wind. Ned, however, did
not attempt to move directly toward the destination
he sought.
</p>
<p>
Instead he sailed off to the south, working
west as much as possible. He tacked as a yacht
tacks in the wind and came near upsetting several
times. He found it impossible to sail low
on account of the eddies and currents created
by the heat, and so lifted the machine far up
into the air. It was better sailing there, and
he managed to get as far west as he thought
necessary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
But he could not see the landing place.
Below was an ocean of smoke, the waves heaving
in the touch of the wind, the edges now and
then tipped with flame. Above the sun smiled
at him, and the birds flew excitedly about, peering
down at the threatening roll of clouds.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid,” Frank said, grasping an
upright and clinging to the water bags.
</p>
<p>
“I never was so frightened in my life,” Ned
called back, lifting his voice so that it might be
heard above the snapping of the motors.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t finish,” Frank called back, his
heart thumping loudly. “I wanted to say that
I was afraid we’d sweep past the workers when
we descended into the smoke and the swifter
breeze near the earth.”
</p>
<p>
“I said just what I wanted to say,” Ned
answered. “I never was half so scared in all
my life.”
</p>
<p>
Yet his hand on the lever was steady, his
brain was as cool as if he had been sitting in the
Wolf Patrol club room in New York. He knew
that the dip of a wing a foot lower than he intended
might send them both into the blazing forest
below. He was afraid, but not with a shrinking,
physical fear, but afraid because he understood
the peril he was in—because he knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
upon his efforts depended the lives of the heroes
in the heated hell below.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to go into that mess of smoke, I
suppose?” shouted Frank.
</p>
<p>
“There is no other way,” Ned called back.
“We’ve got to dip down low enough to see the
line of fire and take our chances on landing where
the fighters are. You understand that they are
farther to the east than when we left them?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course they have been driven back,”
Frank said. “I never thought of that. We
may not be able to find them at all.”
</p>
<p>
Ned shut his teeth and settled his jaw.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to find them,” he said.
</p>
<p>
A long, sullen roaring, like the beating of
waves on a beach in a storm, now reached the
boys’ ears, even shutting out the chattering of
the motors. It came from the west, and passed
along, as it seemed, below the level held by the
aeroplane, now high up in the air.
</p>
<p>
“If we don’t get down there pretty soon,”
Ned said, shouting, “we will be too late. That
wind will join the different fires and make one
roaring mass of the whole northwest. I wish
I knew just how far the foresters have been
driven back.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where to look for them, north
or south?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“There is a peak to the west and one to the
east,” was the reply. “They are on a line with
the two. But the trouble is that we can’t see
the peaks after we drop down into the smoke.”
</p>
<p>
“There appears to be a little lull in the wind
now,” Frank said, shutting his lips tight, as a
man does when about to make a sudden plunge
into unknown waters.
</p>
<p>
The remark was suggestive. Ned knew by
it that his chum had braced himself for the dash.
</p>
<p>
“Here we go, then,” Ned replied. “Remember
that we’ll go about eighty miles an
hour when I turn the motor on full head, and
that we can’t be more than five miles from the
spot where we left them, so keep your eyes out.”
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane dipped gracefully as Ned
touched the lever. In a minute the boys were
surrounded by smoke. It was hot smoke, too,
and made breathing difficult. Their eyes smarted
until their faces were wet with nature’s protest
against such irritation of the organs of sight.
The chuck-chuck, snap-snap of the motors was
in their ears, the seats they occupied—frail
rests between life and death—shivered under
the pulsations of the machine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
Now and then the aeroplane dipped frightfully,
but the wings and the rudders brought it
back again.
</p>
<p>
“Can you see the earth yet?” asked Frank,
In an awed tone, which sounded like a whisper
in that clatter.
</p>
<p>
“We seem to be over the fire,” Ned returned.
</p>
<p>
And that was all. There was no need of
conversation. In all their lives they would
never be so near to a frightful death as they were
then.
</p>
<p>
First they caught sight of a rocky ridge.
Ned knew where that was, and realized that
he was still in the direct line of the workers.
Beyond this ridge, he knew, was a valley, so
he must drop down. The workers were on a
level beyond the valley, a great plain of fir
and pine between gigantic ranges of the Rocky
Mountains.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane trembled as she dropped, swiftly,
apparently straight down. Frank grasped
his upright and prepared to spring out of the
wreckage when it fell, if there was anything to
fall from after the trees had had their way with
the frail machine.
</p>
<p>
The smoke was blinding. Nothing could be
seen but smoke for a time. Then the dark gray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
clouds turned red, and Ned knew that he was
nearing the advance line of the fire, and that it
was mounting to the very tops of the giant trees
on the plain—or elevated plateau, rather, for,
though comparatively smooth of surface and
heavily timbered, it was far above sea level.
</p>
<p>
If you look on an enlarged map of northern
Montana you will see that the Rocky Mountains
do not consist of one great, massive range.
There are ridges and valleys, and plateaus extending
for hundreds of miles along the British
frontier. There are peaks from which the snow
never disappears, and there are timber lines
which crawl almost to the summit of other peaks.
There are fertile valleys where cattle grow fat,
and great gorges where beasts of prey await
their victims in thickets.
</p>
<p>
It is the timber on this great stretch of country
that the United States government is trying
to save.
</p>
<p>
The heat was blistering now, and Ned feared
for the safety of his gasoline tanks. At a motion
from him Frank removed his coat, carefully, for
a slight movement in the air is sometimes productive
of disastrous results, placed it over the
tanks, after a great effort, and managed to saturate
it with water from one of the bags.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
Through the smoke a line of tree tops now
came into view, low down, and the boys knew
that they had passed the fire line. Ned tried
to slow down, but found that he must keep the
motors going in order to retain control of the
machine.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a clear space ahead!” Frank
shouted, and Ned dropped. Then a giant trunk
obtruded itself, and the boy tried to dip and
whirl so as to dodge it, but the pressure of the
wind was too strong.
</p>
<p>
The machine headed straight for the tree,
which seemed to Frank to be about a thousand
feet high.
</p>
<p>
“Hang on to the first thing that comes to
your hands if she strikes!” Ned shouted. “But
stick to the ’plane as long as she is clear. There
may be a current of air which will sweep us away
from that tree.”
</p>
<p>
“Here’s hoping!” Frank gasped back, and
then the smoke shut out the view, making the
situation doubly dangerous.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—TOLD BY THE FOREST RANGER.</h2>
<p>
The rangers, almost exhausted, were fighting
the fire desperately, hoping against hope, when
the cyclone—it amounted at times almost to
that—struck the forest. Then they knew that
the fight was lost for the time being.
</p>
<p>
It was now a question of escaping from the
flames they had been battling with. The chief
foresters knew very well that there was a way
to safety, but they had under their command
many rangers who had joined the service merely
for the adventures they anticipated meeting,
and these, they understood, would be hard to
manage.
</p>
<p>
When the order came to drop everything and
fall back some of the new men accused those in
authority of cowardice and kept on in the course
mapped out for them under entirely different
conditions. Two of them even insisted on starting
back to the rough shanty and preparing
dinner. They lost their way in the blazing
inferno, and their bones were found two weeks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
later, at the foot of a tree which had been
burned into a stub, but which had not fallen.
</p>
<p>
When the danger became apparent to Green
who was in charge of the company found by
Nestor, he ordered his men into a “burn” of
half a dozen acres in extent. By “burn” is
meant a patch of forest which has been cleared
by fire the previous year. This “burn” was
entirely stripped of trees. The fire had done
its work well, but had been checked before
spreading.
</p>
<p>
The men could hear trees falling as they
dashed along. The fire was screaming, the wind
whistling and roaring. Coals of fire, driven like
arrows by the wind, hit the men in the back as
they rushed toward safety. At last the “burn”
was gained, and the men threw themselves face
down on the ground. At the eastern edge there
were large logs which had not been entirely
consumed, and some of the men lay down
behind them.
</p>
<p>
The air was so hot that it cut the lungs like
acid. Above, across the old “burn,” streamed
a river of flame, now racing like a mountain
torrent, now dropping sullenly back to the west,
like a fiery ceiling which had been rolled away.
On such occasions the fainting foresters below
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
could catch a breath of fresh air and a hazy
view of the sky.
</p>
<p>
Some of the men, half crazed by their sufferings,
arose to their feet and shook clenched hands
at the blazing forests, at the brassy sky, and the
green hills away to the east. Green crept from
one to another and whispered that the only hope
of life lay in keeping on the ground.
</p>
<p>
Once when he was creeping toward a man
who was moaning in anguish and despair he
turned his eyes upward to the sky, clear for an
instant, for the wind was wayward after a time,
and saw a speck sweeping out of the west, dropping
lower and lower, whirling in the wind, racing
like an express train.
</p>
<p>
“Dan,” he whispered to the man he was trying
to comfort, “get a brace! There’s no use
of giving up now. Why, man, the fight is won,
and Nestor is coming back with water!”
</p>
<p>
“Impossible!” grunted the other. “Impossible—in
this wind!”
</p>
<p>
“Then look,” Green said.
</p>
<p>
A sheet of flame swept over the “burn,” lay
upon it for an instant like a red-hot roof, and
then warped and twisted itself away.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” Dan said, looking into the sky again,
“but he can’t land. Impossible—in this storm!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait and see!” Green said, and sank back
to the earth.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane circled, high up, like a bird
seeking its prey in the burning forest. The
wind was tolerably steady at that height, but
Ned knew that when he came into the lower
current he would meet conditions which he
could not understand.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a place to drop!” Frank shouted
to him, pointing ahead to the “burn,” which
seemed only a few yards away.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane had missed the tree which had
threatened it by an inch, and had turned upward
again, for there were other trees in the
way of a descent there. The “burn” was the
first free spot that had been observed, and,
besides, it lay inside the line Ned had figured as
leading to the foresters.
</p>
<p>
“Hang on!” Ned cried.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane plunged down, almost vertically,
and Frank felt as if he was standing on
his head.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t jump when it strikes the ground,”
Ned commanded.
</p>
<p>
Watched by a score of anxious eyes—for the
foresters under Green had all been told of the
coming relief—the aeroplane shot down, struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
the ground at the center of the “burn,” rolled
swiftly for a few yards, and stopped. At that
moment the space above filled with flame.
</p>
<p>
Both boys threw themselves on the ground
and waited. When the fierce gust was over the
men gathered about them eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Did you make it?” asked Green.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Ned replied. “Get the bags out
and distribute the water. Don’t let the men
waste it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see to that,” cried Green.
</p>
<p>
Without the water, without the cooling sips,
without the wet cloths held over nose and mouth,
without the saturated sponges laid on scorched
heads, the men would have died there in the
forest. Presently, when the consumption of the
timber to the west reduced the heat, when the
wind quieted down in a measure, they were
ready for another fight with the flames, and it
was owing largely to their exertions that the
fire was extinguished before millions of acres
had been burned over.
</p>
<p>
“It is a dream!” Green exclaimed, that afternoon,
as he stood by Ned and the aeroplane.
“I don’t believe yet that you did it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how I did,” laughed Ned.
“Anyhow, I’m sure I couldn’t do it again. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
guess Providence took the matter into his own
hands. Honestly, I do not believe any human
strength or skill could do what was done with
the aeroplane to-day. It was a miracle.”
</p>
<p>
“I know of a nervy boy who had something
to do with the miracle,” said Green.
</p>
<p>
Ned was naturally anxious regarding Pat,
Jack and Jimmie, but believed they would show
up in good form whenever he got back to the
vicinity of the place where they had been left.
When the boys were in camp with the rangers
that night, Ned asked Frank about Pat’s idea
of safety after refusing to go up in the aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
“He said he would stay about the valley,”
Frank replied. “There is plenty of provisions
there, you know, and Pat is quite long on the
eats,” he added, with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“And Jack and Jimmie will be sure to hang
about the neighborhood of the caves,” Ned said.
“The Chinese boy, Liu, will be able to care for
them. If there is enough gasoline in the tanks,
I may go back to the valley to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better get some sleep to-night,”
Frank advised. “I don’t know how long it
has been since you settled down for a night
of it. If you keep your brain working right
you’ve got to sleep.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“I really ought to go to San Francisco,” was
the astonishing reply to this advice. “I have
work to do there.”
</p>
<p>
“What work?” demanded Frank.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” Ned answered, “we have done
nothing yet, except discover a crime with which
we are supposed to have nothing to do. We
have brought a little water for the fire-fighters,
but we came here for a certain purpose, and we
have not made good as yet. Perhaps, when I
get to Frisco, I can hunch my wits, as the baseball
fans say, and report good progress.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand what you mean,”
Frank said.
</p>
<p>
“I am not sufficiently sure of my ground to
attempt an explanation now,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” Frank said, thoughtfully,
“there’s the murder case you went to Frisco
about before. You might look that up again,
but I can’t see where that has any bearing on
this forest fire business.”
</p>
<p>
“You may be surprised,” Ned said, “when
the end comes. Somehow, I have an idea that
the two crimes dovetail into each other.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing stirring!” laughed Frank. “They
don’t seem to me to match. Still, you may
have information I do not possess.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
An hour later, after the not very elaborate
supper had been eaten, Green came to the little
tent which had been set aside for Ned and Frank.
He had not wholly escaped the dangers of the
day unscathed. There were burns on his hands
and face, and one of his feet was bandaged.
</p>
<p>
“Shoe burned through,” he said, shortly.
“I shall have to walk with a crutch for several
days.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t like that,” Ned suggested.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” was the reply, “especially as
I would like to be moving about in order to see
what has happened to the other boys.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard from any of the other
groups?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Howard came in from the north,” was the
reply. “Three men killed up there. The fire
caught them unawares. One of my men has
gone south, but it will be some hours before I
hear from him.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid there were several lives lost,”
Ned said. “In the morning I’ll fly about and
see what I can learn.”
</p>
<p>
“What I came here to talk about,” Green
said, after a pause, “is this. I want to know
what you think of the Chinks?”
</p>
<p>
“The Chinese fire-fighters?” asked Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
Green laughed quietly for a moment before
replying. Then:
</p>
<p>
“They told you that, did they?”
</p>
<p>
Ned nodded. He wanted to jump into the
subject without waiting for Green to have his
say, for he was greatly interested, but prudence
told him to listen to the forester first.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said. “They told me that.”
</p>
<p>
“Also that they were foresters—the men who
told the story about the Chinks, I mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, one of them claimed to be in charge of
this district.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you know better than that now, so
there is no use in talking about that. You saw
some of the Chinks?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly. I even had the honor of visiting
their residence.”
</p>
<p>
Frank laughed, wondering what sort of a
story Ned would have to tell him when they
were alone again.
</p>
<p>
“It is a wonder you ever got out again,”
Green said.
</p>
<p>
“I left under the excitement of the fire,”
Ned said. “It was easy enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where the Chinks have gone?”
asked Green.
</p>
<p>
“I think I do,” was the reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
“To San Francisco?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, some of them. Others to Portland,
I think.”
</p>
<p>
“Smuggled in?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, though it seems odd that they
should want to cross the border so far away from
civilization. It must be expensive getting them
in over such a route.”
</p>
<p>
“The men at the bottom of the game are
watched,” Green said. “Watched so closely
that they are obliged to keep out of the actual
work and do their business through unsuspected
channels. After this place has been raided they
will try some other point.”
</p>
<p>
“You know what has been going on then?”
asked Ned, surprised that the matter, as understood
by the forester, had not been reported to
him by the Secret Service man in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“And you have reported to your superior officers?”
</p>
<p>
Green nodded, and Ned began to feel provoked
at the strange attitude taken by the
government in the matter. Surely he should
have been posted as to conditions in the district
before being sent on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why wasn’t I informed of this new element
in the case?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Green replied, “the officials have
an idea that the men who are running the Chinks
and the opium in are the men who are responsible
for the forest fires. In fact, I have so reported
to them for a long time.”
</p>
<p>
“Go on,” the puzzled boy requested.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” Green continued, “I might go
and pick up a couple of dozen Chinks almost
any month, and capture a lot of opium, and
arrest a few men caught with the goods on, but,
don’t you see, that wouldn’t end the game?”
</p>
<p>
“I see that,” Ned answered.
</p>
<p>
“There is a man at the head of this game who
is working from behind the scenes somewhere,”
Green hastened to say. “I don’t know who he
is. The officials at San Francisco don’t know
who he is, or where he is. The big guns at
Washington know just about as much regarding
the head center of the game as we do. Well,
that is what you were sent here for—to get down
to cases, as I used to say on South Clark street,
Chicago.”
</p>
<p>
“It was thoughtful of them not to interrupt
the game until I got here,” Ned said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I thought so,” Green went on. “I
thought that any man, or boy, coming here to
get to the bottom of this thing would want us
to leave a few ropes hanging out for him to climb
down. You found ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I found them,” Ned replied. “I
found the counterfeit foresters and the Chinks,
as you call them, and I found something else.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what we expected you would do,”
Green said, after a moment’s hesitation. “We
wanted you to begin without pointers, with a
brain free of all the unsuccessful schemes which
have been worked. You see, I know a great
deal about it, my boy,” he added with a laugh.
“I knew, days ago, that you would be here.
When I saw the aeroplane in the sky I knew
who was in charge of it.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the next move?” asked the boy.
</p>
<p>
“That is for you to say,” was the reply. “I
am under orders to follow any reasonable instructions
from you. It is for you to suggest something.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Ned said, “that brings me to a point
I was studying over when you came in. I was
wondering if you would detail men to do certain
things for me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure I will. If Washington has confidence
enough in you to put you in charge of the blindest
case in history, why shouldn’t I have equal
confidence in you? You bet I’ll be there with
the oxen when you give the word.”
</p>
<p>
“I thank you,” Ned replied. “What I
want now is men enough to guard two points.
One is a cave near Lake Kintla, and the other is
the cavern where the Chinese have been hiding.”
</p>
<p>
“How many men?” asked Green.
</p>
<p>
“Two to each place. If there is need of
more, others should be ready to assist.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you all success,” Green said, after
the details of the surveillance had been arranged.
“We have located the tools, and now it is for
you to let down to bed rock. The government
wants the headpiece of this game, and believes
that you can put your finger on him. Half a
dozen inspectors have failed, but I have faith
in you, boy.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Ned replied, “I am glad of your confidence,
and thankful for the help you promise,
and will only say that the man behind the
scenes will soon be brought out. I think I know
his ‘cue’!” he added, with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Already?” asked Green.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am only expressing confidence in the
clues I now hold,” Ned said in reply. “It may
be that the next clues I find will point the other
way.”
</p>
<p>
Green shook hands with the boys and went
to his tent. It was a clear night up above the
mountain tops, but down where the boys were
the smoke of consumed forests lay on the ground
like the gray ghost of fallen trees. Off to the
west the summit of the Rocky Mountains—or
one of the summits—lifted itself above the
smudge, standing like a giant up to his neck in
gray dust.
</p>
<p>
“Over there,” Frank said, “is Pat—hungry,
if you want to know, and nearer are Jack and
Jimmie. I wish we could hear from them.”
</p>
<p>
“If the ground wasn’t still red hot back
there,” Ned said, “Jimmie would be sure to
find us.”
</p>
<p>
“By the way,” Frank said, presently, “what
did you mean when you told Green that you
had a ‘cue’ which would bring out the man
behind the scenes?”
</p>
<p>
“I meant that I have blundered on a clue
which promises well,” was the reply. “And
now,” he said, yawning, “I’m going to bed.
Rather warm, but I think I’ll sleep, all right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
In five minutes Ned was sound asleep and
Frank was about to lie down by his side when
Green made his appearance. The forester noted
the sleeping boy and laid a finger on his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Let him sleep,” he said. “And come out
here and see if you know anything about the
fellow that is tampering with the aeroplane.”
</p>
<p>
“What is he doing to it?” whispered Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Acts like he was preparing to take a trip
in it,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
The words were followed by the rattle of the
motors.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—HOW A CAT TREED A WOLF.</h2>
<p>
Smoke still hung over the “burn.” Now
and then it was swept aside by a gust of wind
which seemed now to blow out of the east, and
so did not come sizzling with the heat of burned
forests. The general effect, however, was that
of a heavy, stifling fog, and Green and Frank
crept along toward the aeroplane with their
hands held out before their faces.
</p>
<p>
The clatter of the motors had ceased, but
the tap-tap of steel on steel was faintly heard
as they neared the machine. Occasionally the
worker, whoever he was, ceased his tapping, as
if listening.
</p>
<p>
“He’s got his nerve with him,” Frank whispered,
as they moved along.
</p>
<p>
“How did he get here?” asked Green.
“That is the question that is troubling me.”
</p>
<p>
Presently the two came up so that the figure
of the man could be discerned, standing before
the bulk of the planes. Green sprang forward
and seized him by the arm. For an instant it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
seemed as if the capture would be made without
a struggle, then a shot was fired and a crouching
figure leaped away.
</p>
<p>
Frank saw the forester fall and leaped toward
the retreating figure. The race in the
darkness, caused by the pall of smoke which
followed, was short, for Frank was a noted runner
and soon overhauled the fugitive. He did not
attempt to take hold of the man as he came up.
He knew that such a course might mean an unequal
contest, for he was only a boy.
</p>
<p>
Instead, he dropped to the ground and caught
one of the runner’s ankles in both hands. Naturally
the fellow plunged to the ground head-first.
He turned quickly and leveled a revolver.
There was no warning. The shot came instantly,
the bullet passing over the boy’s head as he
dropped upon the prostrate figure.
</p>
<p>
With the hand which held the weapon held
closely to the ground, Frank struggled with the
fellow for an instant, filling the heavy air with
his cries for assistance. The first shot had been
heard by the sleepers, and help was at hand
immediately. The captive was neatly tied by
the light of Frank’s flashlight, and the foresters
gathered about, still rubbing their eyes.
</p>
<p>
The “burn” was not all in darkness all the
time, for the glare of the smouldering embers to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
the west lighted the place fairly well. Only
for the smoke the ruddy light would have made
a pretty good illumination. When the fellow
was lifted to his feet an exclamation of astonishment
came from the group about him.
</p>
<p>
“Sawyer!” some one cried.
</p>
<p>
The prisoner dropped his chin for a moment,
as if studying out some difficult proposition,
then faced the others sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I could get away with it,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
A cry now came from the men who had hastened
to Green’s assistance.
</p>
<p>
“He’s dead, I guess,” the voice said.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t shoot to kill,” Sawyer exclaimed.
“He can’t be dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Why did you shoot at all?” demanded one
of the rangers, approaching Sawyer with threatening
fists.
</p>
<p>
“He was in my way,” was the sullen reply.
“I have always wanted an aeroplane, and I
thought this a good time to get one.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you injure the machine in any way?”
asked Frank, as Sawyer stood gazing furtively
from face to face, his black eyes showing fear.
</p>
<p>
“When I found I couldn’t get it off,” was
the reply, “I loosened some of the burrs. It
can be repaired easily enough.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is more than can be said for you, if
you have killed Green,” one of the men declared,
shaking a fist at the prisoner. “If he’s dead
you’ll be hauled up on one of these trees.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t dare do that!” Sawyer cried.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t we?” cried the other. “You’ll
see when we know whether he will live or not.
How is it, boys?” he continued, stepping toward
the spot where Green lay.
</p>
<p>
The man bending over Green was about to
reply when Nestor laid a hand on his arm. The
boy had been awakened at the first shot and
had slipped out of his tent and over to the side of
the wounded man, being the first to arrive there.
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” he said, as the ranger looked up
in surprise. “Green is not seriously injured,”
Ned went on, “but I want to make that rascal
think he is.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the idea?” asked the other, glancing
from face to face about him.
</p>
<p>
“When he stands under a tree with a rope
about his neck,” Ned said, “he’ll tell us the
truth about this affair.”
</p>
<p>
“He was trying to steal the machine,” the
other said.
</p>
<p>
“Green has a bullet hole through his shoulder,”
Ned said, “but I want you to treat the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
prisoner as if the shot had been fatal. Kindly
carry him to his tent.”
</p>
<p>
The command was instantly obeyed, for the
foresters all knew why Ned was there, and understood
that he was the personal representative
of the Secret Service chief at Washington. Ned
then called Frank aside and spoke a few words
in a whisper. The boy grinned and hastened
back to the group about Sawyer.
</p>
<p>
“Nestor wants to talk with Sawyer,” he explained,
“and wants me to take him to his tent.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll take him to Nestor’s tent after we
get done with him,” declared a burly forester
whose face bore many evidences of the hard fight
he had made during the fire. “It won’t take
us long to settle with him.”
</p>
<p>
Frank spoke a few words to the man and he
was one of the first to push the prisoner toward
Nestor’s tent.
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll keep those men off me,” were
Sawyer’s first words, “I’ll tell you what you
want to know. They mean to kill me.”
</p>
<p>
“I think there is little doubt about that,”
was Ned’s reply. “Why did you want the
aeroplane?”
</p>
<p>
“If you must know,” was the reply, “I was
sent here to get it, or to wreck it so you couldn’t
use it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
</p>
<p>
This looked promising, and Ned waved a
hand at Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Throw him out here!” came a gruff voice
from the crowd.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t tell,” Sawyer went on, “unless you
promise to keep them away from me. I didn’t
mean to kill Green, and no court will convict
me.”
</p>
<p>
“When did you come here?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“A month ago,” was the reply. “The day
you landed in San Francisco a man came to my
boarding house and employed me.”
</p>
<p>
“He mentioned the aeroplane?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he knew all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Treachery in the Secret Service, eh?” asked
Ned.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how he gained his information,”
was the reply. “He told me that he had
secured a job for me in the forest service, and
that I was to join the crew in this district.”
</p>
<p>
“And steal the aeroplane?”
</p>
<p>
“Steal it or wreck it. There are men with
the other crews. You would have found an
enemy wherever you landed.”
</p>
<p>
This was all very amazing, and Ned wondered
how many pitfalls had been set for him in
San Francisco. He had no doubt that Sawyer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
was telling the truth. The question was as to
whether he would tell the story as it was from
that point on.
</p>
<p>
“Who was it that engaged you—gave you
your instructions?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Ned swung his hand again, and a fierce demand
that the prisoner should be thrown out
arose from the group outside. Sawyer shivered
and crept out of his camp-chair to Nestor’s side.
His face was deadly pale, being sheltered from
the ruddy glow of the fires. Just where the men
stood outside lay a red lance of light, giving a
demon-like look to their rugged faces.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t tell me the truth,” Ned said,
“I can’t protect you.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I don’t know,” wailed the frightened
man. “I had never seen him before. I
wanted a job and took what he offered. I
didn’t think it would be so great a crime to steal
or wreck an aeroplane.”
</p>
<p>
“What were you to receive for the job?”
</p>
<p>
“One thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurry up! Throw that sneak out!”
</p>
<p>
Sawyer, like the coward he was, threw himself
down on the floor of the tent and groveled
at Ned’s feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“You would know the man again?” asked
Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I can pick him out of a score of men.”
</p>
<p>
“You will do this willingly?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I’m sick of the whole game. I didn’t
mean to hurt Green. I wanted to scare him
away so I could get back to my tent without
being recognized. That is all I wanted, and I
did not mean to hit him at all.”
</p>
<p>
There was a great deal more talk between
the two. Ned soon became convinced that
Sawyer was a weak man, morally and intellectually,
who would be apt to follow the lead of
one stronger than himself.
</p>
<p>
After Ned had left a guard over the man
and visited Green—who was doing very well,
and laughing over the trick the boy had played
on Sawyer—he went back to his rough bed, well
satisfied with the events of the night.
</p>
<p>
“By the way,” Frank said, crawling into
the tent after assisting in caring for the wounded
man, “I don’t understand what you mean by
saying that you’ve got a clue which you think
will force the man behind the scenes out on the
stage, in full view of the audience. If there is
such a clue hovering about I haven’t become
acquainted with it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
</p>
<p>
“The clue is hardly well enough advanced to
talk about,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“But if you’ve got a line on the leader of this
bunch you’ve won the case,” suggested Frank.
</p>
<p>
“That is what the government sent me here
for,” Ned replied. “The chief of the Secret
Service expects me to round up the man responsible
for the frequent forest fires. I think
now that he should have told me that smuggling
was going on up here, but he may have had a
good reason for not doing so.”
</p>
<p>
“You know what Mr. Green said,” Frank
interrupted. “He said the government officers
wanted you to take the case and find out everything
for yourself. Perhaps they feared that
you would pay too much attention to these
smugglers, and let the forest fires issue go with
scant investigation. They might have arrested
the smugglers at any time, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps so,” Ned replied, “But that wouldn’t
have brought the manager of the unlawful
enterprises into the hands of the law. After
all, the Secret Service men may have been right
in sending me up here without instructions or
special information. What a laugh they would
have had if I had failed to discover the Chinamen
and the opium.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they wanted to see if you would
discover them,” laughed Frank. “Have you
any idea,” he added, “that the Secret Service
men knew that you would be followed in here—that
the plans of the government regarding your
work were known to the outlaws? Do you think
they knew of the employment of Sawyer and the
others by the men at the head of the conspiracy?”
</p>
<p>
“No; I hardly think the man who gave me
final orders at San Francisco knew that all he
did was known to the men he was fighting,”
Ned replied. “The head of the bunch put a
good one over on him there.”
</p>
<p>
“And came near putting one over on you,
also,” grinned Frank. “The aeroplane has been
attacked twice already, and others are doubtless
waiting to get a crack at it.”
</p>
<p>
“They will have to hurry up if they do,”
Ned said, with a chuckle, “and you will have to
look out for yourself if they succeed, for I’m
going to have you take me to Missoula in the
morning and then go back and collect the boys.”
</p>
<p>
“And not come back here again?” asked
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Not unless we come back for a pleasure
trip,” was the reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Frank said, “that pleasure trip idea
looks pretty good to me. Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“I may have time,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
Frank threw himself on the blankets which
had been provided by Mr. Green and closed his
eyes, which were still smarting from the effects
of the smoke.
</p>
<p>
“If you go away to-morrow,” he said, presently,
“what is to become of the clues we found
in the cavern by the lake?”
</p>
<p>
“All provided for,” Ned answered.
</p>
<p>
“And all the Chinks, and everything you
discovered while visiting them in the caves almost
under the divide?”
</p>
<p>
“Everything provided for,” Ned said, sleepily.
</p>
<p>
“And you think you can close this case by
going to San Francisco?” demanded Frank, a
touch of sarcasm in his tone.
</p>
<p>
“Go to sleep, little boy,” said Ned, in a
tantalizing tone.
</p>
<p>
“But do you?” insisted the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I do,” was the muttered reply.
“Go to sleep, little man!”
</p>
<p>
And Frank tried to obey, but sleep would
not come. The fire still smouldered over in the
west. The ruddy light of the embers was still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
touching the camp with its red fingers. The
smoke was still asserting itself in the air. The
puzzle was still there!
</p>
<p>
After the boy had rolled over at least fifty
times, and arose to consult a water bag at least
a dozen times, he seated himself under the flap
of the tent and looked out. There was a moon
now, and the smoke only half hid it. Far off
in the woods wild creatures were expressing
their opinion of the fire and the wanton destruction
of their homes. There was a faint rustle
in the foliage of the trees east of the “burn.”
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” the boy muttered. “I’d like to
come back here for a month!”
</p>
<p>
Then his attention was attracted to the savage
growl of some animal in the thicket beyond
the fire limit of the “burn.” It seemed to the
boy as if some man-eating creature had cornered
a bit of animate supper, but couldn’t
reach it. The language used by the forest resident
seemed to be in the tongue of the panther.
While he listened a cry which was not that of a
hungry beast came out of the gloom.
</p>
<p>
That was a cry for help, surely. Frank put
his revolver and his searchlight into convenient
pockets and set out for the scene of the disturbance,
without awakening any of the sleepers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
It was slow work pushing through the bushes,
and the boy wondered if a fire there, well guarded
on a quiet day, wouldn’t be a good thing.
</p>
<p>
He kept his searchlight ahead and looked
about for the source of the noises as he advanced
in the darkness. In a short time he heard a
voice he knew, but hardly expected to hear
there.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry up!” the voice said. “I’m goin’ to
tumble out of this tree in about a minute! I’m
that hungry! I thought you might meet me
with a pie under one arm.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, why don’t you come down, then?”
Frank asked.
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll turn your honorable attention to
that tree to the east,” Jimmie said, “your excellency
will observe a panther waiting for his
supper. He’s been tracking me all day, getting
bolder every minute. Now, if I turn this searchlight
away for an instant, he’ll jump on me, and
there you are. No more Jimmie McGraw than
a rabbit!”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see your light at first,” Frank said,
“for it was hidden by the foliage of the trees.
I suppose you want me to shoot the cat?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—THE TIME FOR THE ROUND-UP.</h2>
<p>
“Sure,” Jimmie answered. “Shoot the cat!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, keep your light on him, and wait
until I can get where I can see him. The cat
frequently resents being wounded.”
</p>
<p>
“Cripes!” cried Jimmie. “Don’t shoot unless
you kill him, for he’ll jump at me then for
sure. He’s angry now—hear him pound with
his tail? I fired all my loads at him an’ he
dodged the bullets.”
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t shoot craps!” scorned Frank.
</p>
<p>
The panther, a great brute made ferocious
by the excitement of the fire, and probably
scorched a little, could now be heard moving
in the branches of a tree not far from that
in which Jimmie was perched. In a moment
Frank reached a point from which the beast’s
face could be seen.
</p>
<p>
He thought to himself that it looked like a
tiger head fastened against a gray cloud with
unseen pins. Jimmie’s searchlight brought the
evil face, the cruel eyes, the back-sloping ears,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
the faintly-moving jaws, out into strong relief,
as the circle of flame was only large enough to
cover the face.
</p>
<p>
The beast heard Frank moving in the bushes
below and turned its head to look, at the same
time crouching low, as if to spring.
</p>
<p>
The first bullet struck him fair in the throat,
the second entered the head just above the eyes,
the third, coming so rapidly on the others that
the three reports seemed to merge into one,
entered the body over the heart. The great
beast was dead when the body struck the ground.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie was not long in getting down to
Frank’s side and grasping him by the shoulders
in a hug which threatened to end in a scuffle.
</p>
<p>
“Get away!” Frank said. “Suppose there’s
another cat here? If there is he’ll get one of us
through your foolishness.”
</p>
<p>
“There were two,” Jimmie said, coolly, “but
I killed one.”
</p>
<p>
“How did you get here?” was the next question,
asked as the boys turned toward the camp.
</p>
<p>
“How do you think I got here?” returned
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“Walked!” laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I walked.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie stopped and rubbed his legs with
careful hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m all wore out!” he said. “I can’t walk
any farther to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Frank said, with a grin. “I’ll
leave you both lights to keep the cats off with,
and my gun, and come out after you in the
morning after breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my eats!” Jimmie cried. “Lead me
to something that will sustain life! I’m starving,
I tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“You walked all the way?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Sure! Forty miles at least.”
</p>
<p>
“Where are the others?”
</p>
<p>
“Pat, Jack and the Chink Scout? Pat came
up just before I started, riding on a burro, an’
in the custody of a small party of rangers, who
thought he had been setting fires. The rangers
went into camp over there, all tired out, an’
Jack an’ Pat settled down with them. I run
away.”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t know where you are?” asked
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Nix know!” replied the boy.
</p>
<p>
“But how did you ever get through the burning
forest?” asked Frank, hardly believing the
boy’s story of his long walk.
</p>
<p>
“This ‘burn’ is only a mile wide,” Jimmie
said. “I walked on the south edge of it. Say,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
there are plenty of lives lost! Bears, an’ cats,
an’ all that. I guess this will be an agreeable
place to live in about a week—not!”
</p>
<p>
The boy was indeed “all in,” as he expressed
it. He had walked since early morning through
a tangled forest black with smoke, through an
atmosphere burned and smoked out of its life-giving
qualities. And all this exertion in order
that he might be near his chum, Nestor.
</p>
<p>
Fortune had favored the lad, and he had at
last blundered on the camp where Ned had taken
refuge, otherwise he might have died in the forest
from hunger and exhaustion, or been devoured
by some of the savage beasts which had
followed him all day.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Ned?” Jimmie asked, as they stood
before the little row of tents.
</p>
<p>
“Asleep,” was the reply, “and you let him
alone for to-night. He’s been having a lively
time. But how in the name of all that’s wonderful
did you ever find your way here?” the
boy added.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” was the reply. “I knew
that Ned would be wherever the fire was, and
so started east. Not so very long ago I heard
a couple of shots, and that directed me toward
the camp. Who was hurt?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank explained, briefly, what had taken
place, hunted up a liberal meal for the boy, and
then saw him settled for the night.
</p>
<p>
Ned’s astonishment at seeing the boy in the
morning may well be imagined.
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” Jimmie said. “You thought you
would fool me out of all the fun!”
</p>
<p>
Ned laughed and asked about the others,
finally informing Jimmie that he was leaving
that morning for San Francisco by the aeroplane
route.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’m goin’!” declared the boy. “I’m
not goin’ to be chucked into the discard again.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to sit in Frank’s lap,” grinned
Ned, “and the machine may tip over with such
a load, at that.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess it didn’t tip over when Frank and
Jack an’ yours truly run it,” Jimmie replied.
“Anyway, I’m goin’ with you.”
</p>
<p>
Before leaving for Missoula, where he was
to surrender the aeroplane to Frank, Ned had
another long talk with Mr. Green, whose wound
was not so serious as it had been considered the
night before. The forester told him what he
knew of the men under the leadership of Greer,
saying that he might have arrested Greer at any
time during the month, and, what is more, convicted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
him of smuggling both Chinamen and
opium over the border.
</p>
<p>
“But what good would it have done?” Green
went on. “The conspirators in Washington,
or New York, or San Francisco would have
chosen another leader, and the game would have
gone on as before.”
</p>
<p>
“That is very true,” Ned admitted, “and
still, it seems to me that the time to round the
fellows up has come!”
</p>
<p>
“Do you give that as an order?” asked the
other, a flash of excitement showing in his face.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“But some of them have gone to Portland
with the Chinks—some to Frisco, I think. What
about that?”
</p>
<p>
“If you can spare men,” Ned said, “follow
them.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re on!” laughed Green. “I’ve been
waiting for some such orders for a long time.
You’re on!”
</p>
<p>
“And follow on to Frisco as soon as you can,”
Ned continued. “Address me, or look for me,
if you are able to be about after you get there,
at the Federal building.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be there in a week,” Green said, his
eyes showing the joy of the coming fight with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
the outlaws, “and I’ll have a bunch of prisoners
with me.”
</p>
<p>
The forester hesitated a moment, as the importance
of the proposed move came to him,
then faced Ned with a hesitating look. It was
plain to the boy that Green wanted to ask a
question which he believed to be either personal
or impertinent.
</p>
<p>
“Is there something else?” Ned asked.
</p>
<p>
Green still hesitated, his eyes on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure of your clues?” he asked, then.
</p>
<p>
“I think so,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Because, you see,” Green went on, “the
government doesn’t want any trap sprung until
the whole bilin’ is within reaching distance.
After the good work you have done here, I
wouldn’t like to have you order the round-up
and then find that the men you wanted were
still out on the range.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for your frankness,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“I just want to be sure that you are sure,”
smiled Green. “It would mix things for me to
make these arrests and have the big ones get
away, now, wouldn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed it would,” Ned admitted, “but I
think it is safe to go ahead as we planned a moment
ago.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
“All right!” Green said, but there was still
doubt in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll accept all the responsibility,” Ned
added.
</p>
<p>
“I have a suggestion to make,” Green said,
then. “Why not go on to Frisco in the aeroplane
and ask for instructions? You can make
the trip in the airship in no time, but it is a long
ride by rail.”
</p>
<p>
“I think,” Ned replied, with a laugh, “that
the game will be ripe just about the time I get
to Frisco by rail. Besides, I don’t want the
outlaws to know that I’m going to the city.
They would know it if they saw the aeroplane
making for the coast. Well, if I leave Frank
navigating it in this district they will think I
am still here. Don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
“Go it!” laughed Green. “I reckon you
know what you’re about.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Ned said, “I’ve got to play the
game in my own way if I play it at all.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” observed Green, and the two parted.
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane had not been damaged at all
by the fire, but Ned went over it carefully before
attempting a start. Sawyer, trembling with
fright, was brought out to show where he had
meddled with the machinery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t harm it any,” the prisoner said.
</p>
<p>
“There are some burrs missing,” Ned said.
</p>
<p>
Sawyer brought half a dozen out of a pocket
and passed them to Ned with a reluctant hand.
</p>
<p>
“I neglected to tell you that I had them in
my pocket,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“What did Green say to you this morning?”
asked Ned, screwing the burrs on where they
were needed.
</p>
<p>
“He says he won’t be hard on me, if I tell
all I know about the men who are doing these
tricks,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“You told me all you know?” asked Ned.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, there is nothing else to tell. I’m so
glad to think that Green is not going to die from
the wound I gave him that I’ll do everything in
my power to bring the men who put me up to
this to punishment.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure you can identify the man who hired
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Dead certain,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll have one of the men bring you to
Frisco,” Ned said. “You will be wanted there.”
</p>
<p>
“All right; anything the government wants
goes!”
</p>
<p>
In half an hour the three boys, Ned, Frank
and Jimmie, were on the aeroplane, sailing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
through the clear air of a splendid summer
morning. Below they could see the long, narrow
strip of land which had been swept by the
fires. Off to the north was the British frontier,
with Lake Kintla glimmering in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t we going back to that lake cavern
again?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Not just now,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know that you got all you wanted
in there,” Frank went on. “I had an idea that
you were trying to identify the man we found
dead there.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I learned all there was to learn
there,” Ned replied.
</p>
<p>
“He spent a lot of time in there before he
went to Frisco,” Jimmie said. “He made me
go in there with him, and I didn’t like it.”
</p>
<p>
“And so no one will ever know who the dead
man was?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I have been given a name,” Ned said, “a
name to call him by, but I don’t exactly like to
accept the information, considering the source
from which it came.”
</p>
<p>
The aeroplane drifted to the west and north
easily under the steady pulse of the motors, and
the plateau where Jimmie had left the boys and
the foresters was soon in sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if they’re all alive?” said Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
“What could happen to them?” demanded
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” Jimmie replied, with biting sarcasm,
“there is nothing here to harm ’em! This is a
pink tea, this is! This is a church fair, where
you get ices made out of the cream they skim
off the cistern!”
</p>
<p>
“You’re getting nutty!” Frank said, with a
grin.
</p>
<p>
“When I left ’em,” Jimmie went on, “the
boys an’ the foresters were wondering if the outlaws
would come back an’ kill ’em one by one
or just blow up the caves underneath the plateau
an’ send ’em up in the air without any good
means of gettin’ down.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll look them up,” Ned said.
</p>
<p>
The great divide lay down below, and the
plateau was in plain sight, with the early sunshine
streaming over it. When the aeroplane
circled about it a shout came up to Ned’s ears,
then a shot, and the powder smoke drifted lazily
upward in the clear air.
</p>
<p>
“Somethin’ doin’!” Jimmie cried. “Suppose
we go down an’ see.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—TWO INANIMATE WITNESSES.</h2>
<p>
It was very still in the bachelor apartment,
and, as on the occasion of his previous visit,
Nestor saw, as he slipped through the doorway
leading from the private hall, that the lights
were burning low.
</p>
<p>
On this night there was no opium-drugged
victim lying on the couch. There was a movement
in the room beyond, and Ned could hear
the soft tread of slippered feet and occasionally
the rattle of dishes. It was evident that midnight
luncheon was being prepared, and that
the master of the habitation would soon be on
hand.
</p>
<p>
Closing the door softly—the same having
been opened with a skeleton key—Ned stepped
across the room to the writing desk which he
had examined on that other night. After
searching the half-open drawer for an instant,
he took out a number of papers and examined
them. He also took a check-book out and put
it into a pocket. The papers he returned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
the desk. The check-book was an old one,
there being few blank checks in the binding, but
plenty of stubs.
</p>
<p>
Then Ned looked at the lock of the desk.
It had been out of repair at his previous visit,
but was in excellent shape now. He removed
the new key and inserted the one with the broken
stem which had so excited the interest of Albert
Lemon and Jap on occasion of his previous visit.
</p>
<p>
The key with the broken stem did not fit.
A new lock had been put on. Next Ned went
to a mantel over a gas grate and lifted the cover
from a little ivory box which stood there. At
the very bottom of the box, under buttons, pins,
needles, and odds and ends, he found a key.
This one was whole, and it was an exact duplicate
of the one with the broken stem.

<p>
Ned had been in San Francisco three days,
and Jimmie was not far away. On bringing the
aeroplane to the plateau on the day of his return
to Missoula he had found Ernest Whipple,
Jack, Pat, Liu, and a small party of rangers
anxiously awaiting him. Also “several tough
ones waitin’ for an introduction,” as Jimmie
put it. It seems that the fake foresters had returned
to the cave after the fire in the cañon had
burned itself out and had at once discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
that the prisoner had vanished, also that Liu,
the Chinese boy, had disappeared with him.
</p>
<p>
There had been a long search for the missing
boys, as the outlaws knew very well that the
escape meant the bringing of officers to the caves,
but they had not been discovered until a short
time before the arrival of the aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
When Ned reached the plateau—in fact, before
he reached it—he heard the whistling of
bullets aimed at the big bird. The outlaws
were trying to cripple the aeroplane and so give
the riders a tumble. The boys landed in safety,
however, and joined the others.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the boys thus reinforced, the outlaws
had withdrawn, and the rangers had conducted
them to a pass which led over the divide. So
it was that Ned had left them, making their way
down toward the Valley of the Wild Animals,
where a large number of rangers were encamped,
and where Frank was to come for them with the
aeroplane as soon as Ned landed at Missoula.
</p>
<p>
There were numerous shots fired at the aeroplane
as it mounted into the sky again, but no
harm was done.
</p>
<p>
“If they had been shootin’ at that cat last
night,” Jimmie said, in derision, “they would
’a’ been eaten alive.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are nervous,” Frank said, “and don’t
dare come out of their hiding places so as to get
a good sight at us. They are afraid of the
rangers, and afraid that we’ll drop a bomb or
something of that sort down on them.”
</p>
<p>
This explanation of the bad marksmanship,
as well as the failure of the outlaws to rush the
aeroplane, was accepted by the boys, who had
anticipated a fight with the fellows. It was
afterwards learned, too, that there were only
half a dozen outlaws in the group, and that they
had been sent back to guard the caves and not
to fight rangers unless they were attacked.
</p>
<p>
Ned had been very busy since his return to
the city, having made many inquiries concerning
Albert Lemon and his servant, the Japanese
attendant who had given the boy such a chilly
reception on the night of the first visit.
</p>
<p>
Lemon, he had been informed, was a millionaire
of eccentric habits. According to Ned’s
source of information, he would absent himself
from his usual haunts for days at a time, and
would then return to shut himself up in his
rooms, at home to no one, and attended only by
Jap.
</p>
<p>
After a time the clatter of dishes grew louder
in the adjoining room, giving notice, doubtless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
that the luncheon being prepared was nearly
ready to serve. Then the boy seated himself
behind a screen which cut off a corner of the
room and waited. He had occupied his retreat
only a short time when a key turned in the door
and the man he had talked with on his first visit
entered.
</p>
<p>
It was not the old, half-dazed, disreputable
Lemon who stepped into the room, but a young
man handsomely dressed and evidently very
wide awake and in the best of spirits. After
seeing that the window shades were closely
drawn he turned on the lights and dropped into
a chair at the writing desk.
</p>
<p>
Ned saw him rummage the pigeon-holes for
a moment, extract a folded paper, and fall to
checking off the items. The boy had examined
this sheet while at the desk, and so knew
what it contained. After checking the items
the man drew out a long pocket-book and placed
its contents on the writing board.
</p>
<p>
The boy gave a quick start when he saw
what the book had contained, for a large package
of yellow-back bank notes lay exposed to
view. The man counted them carefully, compared
the total with the figures he had marked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
on the sheet, and then sat back in his chair with
a satisfied smile on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Everything correct!” he said.
</p>
<p>
Then he lighted a cigar and turned to the
door opening into the inner room.
</p>
<p>
“Jap!” he called softly. “Oh, Jap!”
</p>
<p>
The door opened and the servant looked in.
</p>
<p>
“Come here!” Lemon commanded. “What
have you been doing?” he added, as the Jap
stood before him.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“You are not telling the truth,” Lemon said.
“You have been seen about the city, in tea
houses, talking with strangers.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not been out of the rooms,” the
other insisted, stubbornly.
</p>
<p>
“Let it pass,” Lemon said, in a moment.
“There may be some mistake. Any one been
here?”
</p>
<p>
“No one.”
</p>
<p>
The servant appeared to have a perfect
knowledge of English. He looked into his master’s
face with a bland smile, but now and then
his eyes sought the screen behind which Ned
was hidden.
</p>
<p>
“Well, some of the boys will be up here to-night,” Lemon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
said. “See that there is plenty
to eat. Go, now.”
</p>
<p>
The servant turned to the door opening into
the private hall, stood with his hand on the knob
for an instant, and then, apparently changing
his mind, went out through the doorway by
which he had entered. If Lemon had been listening
intently he would have heard a quick
movement in the back room as Jap closed the
door.
</p>
<p>
In a moment there was another movement in
the private hall, and then Ned heard the corridor
door open. He pushed the screen aside and
stepped out before the astonished occupant of
the rooms.
</p>
<p>
“What does this mean?” Lemon demanded,
a quiver of excitement—or it might have been
consternation—in his voice.
</p>
<p>
While he spoke he moved toward a table
where a revolver lay in full view.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind that,” Ned said, coolly. “We
can arbitrate our differences without its assistance.
Besides, it is not loaded.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing here?” Lemon almost
shouted, his face growing white, either with rage
or fear. “Leave the room immediately.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
Ned dropped into a chair and motioned toward
another.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down!” he ordered.
</p>
<p>
“Your impudence is amazing,” Lemon said,
but he took the chair.
</p>
<p>
In a moment, however, he turned to the door.
</p>
<p>
“Jap!” he called.
</p>
<p>
Again the door opened and the servant looked
in.
</p>
<p>
“Are you armed?” Lemon asked.
</p>
<p>
The servant nodded, fixing a pair of inscrutable
eyes on Ned’s face as he did so.
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” was the reply. “Stand there
by the door. How did this man gain entrance
here?”
</p>
<p>
The only reply was a shrug of the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Let it pass for the present,” Lemon said,
with a smile of triumph. “Stand there and
shoot when I give the word.”
</p>
<p>
The servant nodded again. Ned remained
seated, his eyes fixed coolly on the face of the
master.
</p>
<p>
“Now, what do you want?” demanded
Lemon. “You don’t look exactly like a common
sneak thief.”
</p>
<p>
“You doubtless remember,” Ned began, in
a level voice, “that I did myself the honor of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
calling at these rooms not long ago in quest of
information of one—of one Felix Emory?”
</p>
<p>
Lemon started at the name, but gained confidence
as he glanced toward the servant at the
door.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I remember,” he said. “What about
it?”
</p>
<p>
There was a sharp ring at the corridor door
before Ned spoke again. The Jap looked inquiringly
at his master.
</p>
<p>
“Company may prove of value just now,”
Lemon said. “Will you see who is there?”
</p>
<p>
It was clear to Ned that Lemon expected
some of the associates he had mentioned as
“the boys” when giving instructions about the
luncheon, and there was a smile of welcome on
his face when a bustle in the hall told of an
arrival.
</p>
<p>
There was only one man, however, and
Lemon at first seemed disappointed, but in a
moment he had his face under perfect control
again.
</p>
<p>
“Father!” he cried, springing to his feet.
“It is good to see you here!”
</p>
<p>
The newcomer, a man of perhaps sixty,
well dressed and with the air of a man to whom
marked attention was due, stood looking into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
Lemon’s face for an instant and then grasped
his hand.
</p>
<p>
“You have changed little, my son,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Lemon smiled and indicated Ned with a
slight motion of the hand.
</p>
<p>
“Permit me to present to you my father,
Mr. Leon Lemon,” he said, “and this, father,
is a boy burglar who broke into my rooms in
quest of plunder a short time ago,” he added.
“We were having quite a cheerful talk when you
came. I don’t know his name, unfortunately.”
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman gave a start and attempted
to rise from his chair.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t distress yourself,” Lemon said. “He
is quite harmless. Besides, Jap has him covered
with the cannon he delights to carry.”
</p>
<p>
“This is a strange situation,” the other said,
wiping the sweat of excitement from his face.
</p>
<p>
“One of the incidents which add to the joy
of life,” Lemon said. “You remember Felix
Emory?” he added. “Well, his pretense for
this call is that he came to ask about him. Go
ahead, Mr. Burglar.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you will also remember,” Ned
went on, “that on my former visit here I exhibited
a key with a broken stem—the key to
that writing desk?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
Lemon’s face hardened and he glanced furtively
at the servant, but said not a word.
</p>
<p>
“This key,” Ned said, producing the one
mentioned, “was found in the pocket of the man
who was found dead in the Rocky Mountains.
You think you left it in the suit of clothes you
gave Emory?”
</p>
<p>
“Possibly,” was the strained reply. “But
we have had enough of this,” Lemon added.
“Call the police, Jap.”
</p>
<p>
“Just a moment,” Ned went on, when the
Jap moved toward the door. “When you could
not find the key, Mr. Lemon, why didn’t you
use the duplicate. The duplicate you kept in
the box on the shelf? Why did you think it
necessary to break the lock?”
</p>
<p>
“The servant did that,” was the angry
reply.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” Ned replied, coolly, “perhaps that
was done while you were up in the mountains
with Emory—before he was killed?”
</p>
<p>
“Possibly,” Lemon gritted out.
</p>
<p>
“Now, since talking with you,” Ned continued,
“I have been up in the mountains.
There I found a man using a typewriter. By
the way, have you a machine here?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” was the angry reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you formerly used one here?”
</p>
<p>
“Never!” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“That is strange,” Ned said, “for when I
came in here not long ago I took the liberty of
looking through some papers in your desk, for
which I ask your pardon. Well, I discovered
that the machine you used here carried a defective
letter ‘c.’ It looked in the writing like an
‘o.’ The machine the man was using under
the divide had the same defect. If you will
observe the sheet you were examining a few
moments ago, you will note the imperfect letter.”
</p>
<p>
Lemon’s teeth clinked together sharply, but
he did not speak.
</p>
<p>
“When I came here last,” Ned continued,
“you lay in an opium stupor on that couch.
You had recently returned from a trip to Lake
Kintla, where Emory was found dead. While
in that section you visited a cavern on the eastern
slope of the divide. There is where you
used the typewriter taken from these rooms.”
</p>
<p>
“My son never learned the keyboard,” said
the old gentleman, an angry snap in his eyes.
“He has never found it necessary to earn
money.”
</p>
<p>
Lemon turned to the old man and bowed,
gratefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
“When you lay on the couch that night,”
Ned continued, “there was the smear of the
typewriter on the middle finger of your left hand,
close to the nail. I use a double keyboard
machine myself, and sometimes smut my finger
on the ribbon when I turn the platen. Some
papers I chanced upon in the mountains bear
the mark of a smudged hand. You are careless
in using the machine. You even left a blue
record ribbon in the cave headquarters where
the dead man was found. That was my first
valuable clue!”
</p>
<p>
“What papers did you steal while in the
mountains?” demanded Lemon, springing to
his feet, his face deadly white, his fists swinging
aimlessly in the air.
</p>
<p>
“Lists,” Ned replied. “Lists of Chinamen
brought from over the border, and lists of opium
cases smuggled in. I have the papers in my
possession now. They match with the statement
you examined just before I made my appearance
in the room—just before you counted
the money you received from this illegal traffic.”
</p>
<p>
The old man leaped at Ned, but the boy
moved away and stood by the door. The Jap
stepped closer. There came a sound of whispering, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
noise of footsteps, from the hall outside.
Then the door was opened and Greer,
Slocum, Chang Chee and two others entered,
glancing keenly at Ned as they passed him,
still standing by the door.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to accuse my son of crime?”
shouted the old man, not noticing the new-comers
in his rage and excitement. “You
scoundrel!”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know,” Ned asked, with a
smile at the others, “that this man is Albert
Lemon, your son?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—THE MAN BEHIND THE SCENES.</h2>
<p>
“Not my son!” shouted the old man. “This
has gone quite far enough! Jap, call the police,
and order this mad youngster taken away.”
</p>
<p>
The younger man broke into a harsh laugh
and turned to those who had just entered. Slocum
and Chang Chee were whispering together,
and a dangerous looking knife showed in the
hand of the false ranger.
</p>
<p>
“You hear what father says, boys,” Lemon
said. “Remember that.”
</p>
<p>
“What is this kid doing here, anyway?”
demanded Slocum.
</p>
<p>
“He came here, evidently, for the purpose
of blackmailing me,” Lemon said. “He has
papers stolen from the mountains—lists, he
says they are—and they should be taken from
him by force.”
</p>
<p>
Slocum and Chang Chee started toward the
boy, but he waved them back with his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I will lay the papers on the table,” he said.
“You are quite welcome to them for the present.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take him down to the police station,”
said Chang. “He ought not to be at large.
Come, youngster.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to be able to talk pretty good
English now,” laughed Ned. “Much better
than the slang you gave out in the mountains.”
</p>
<p>
“Come!” shouted the Chinaman. “You
are here alone, so there is no need of a fight.
Come along!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see about my being here alone presently,”
Ned said. “Anyhow, I’d better be
here alone than with any one of you in the dark
streets. I should be murdered before a block
was passed. That is what you came to Frisco
for, to murder me—just as the man in the lake
cavern was murdered.”
</p>
<p>
Those in the room looked at each other and
remained silent. There was a tense moment,
when every person there seemed gathering for a
spring, when the lust of blood seemed in every
glaring eye, but it passed.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the Chinamen you brought away
from the British border?” asked Ned of Chang
Chee. “Are they in this city? Oh,” he continued,
as Chang glared at him, “we knew that
you were about to bring in a batch. You usually
light forest fires in order to attract the attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
of the rangers when you get ready to unload a
band of Chinese on Uncle Sam. That is Doyers
street cunning, Chang!”
</p>
<p>
“You see,” he went on, “we have had the
good luck to discover why the forests in Northern
Idaho and Montana have been set on fire
so frequently. I don’t care to say what I think
of the wisdom of your course in so attempting
to hide your movements, except that it attracted
attention instead of diverting it. You
firebugs might have been arrested long ago,”
he continued, turning to Slocum, “but it was
thought best to wait until the head center of
the whole conspiracy was in the hands of the
law. Now that this has been accomplished, I
may speak.”
</p>
<p>
The people standing around the boy looked
into each other’s faces, and there was a movement
as if to draw weapons.
</p>
<p>
“Permit me to congratulate you on the
discovery of the leader of the outlaws,” the old
man said with a snarl. “Perhaps you will be
kind enough to give us his name?”
</p>
<p>
“There are no objections that I know of,”
was the reply. “His name is Felix Emory.
You may have heard of him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
“An old acquaintance of my son Albert,”
the old man said.
</p>
<p>
“That is the name of the man who was so
mysteriously murdered in the Kintla lake
cave,” Slocum observed. “Why do you place
the crime on the dead?”
</p>
<p>
“Felix Emory,” Ned said, “is not dead.
He is alive at this moment—alive and in this
room!”
</p>
<p>
The young man broke into a jarring laugh
and turned to the old man.
</p>
<p>
“You remember the strange resemblance between
Felix and myself,” he said. “Well, it
seems to have deceived this clever young man.
By the way, Slocum, why don’t you take the
lad to the police station? We have no more
time for him here.”
</p>
<p>
Slocum and another sprang forward, but Ned
opened the door with a quick motion and stood
beyond their reach.
</p>
<p>
“The man found dead in the cave,” the boy
said, facing the old man, “had met with an accident
in his youth. The first joint of the little
finger of the right hand was missing. Also,
there was a scar over his left eye—a trifling scar,
made with a knife in the hands of a playmate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
Do you recall these marks of identification, Mr.
Lemon?” he added.
</p>
<p>
The old man threw his hands to his face and
stood silent for a moment while the others looked
on in perplexed silence. When he uncovered
his face again he stepped forward to the man he
had called his son on entering the room.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see your hands, Albert,” he said,
kindly. “Bend down so I can see the scar on
your forehead!”
</p>
<p>
“Step aside, you old fool!” the young man
cried, pushing the old man back rudely. “We
have had enough of this, boys,” he continued,
turning to the others. “The game is up unless
we get rid of this dotard and this boy. Why
don’t you get busy?”
</p>
<p>
The old man dropped into a chair and lifted
his face to Ned’s.
</p>
<p>
“You found my son murdered?” he asked.
“Then this man Felix Emory stands in his
shoes! Even I was deceived by him! Why, he
has been calling upon me for large sums of money
during the past month. He has taken possession
of my boy’s rooms. Was it this man Emory
who killed him?”
</p>
<p>
“We believe so,” was the reply. “The
proof is within reaching distance.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
“Out with them both!” shouted Emory.
</p>
<p>
“Your son Albert took this man in and tried
to do something for him,” Ned went on, “and
was robbed and murdered for his pains. This
man Emory was the leader of this choice band
of smugglers and firebugs when he came to your
son. The band was on the point of scattering
because the officers were close on their track.
They needed a man well up in the world—a man
against whom the breath of suspicion had never
been blown—to represent them in the opium
market and the smuggled Chinamen market.
They sent this man Emory to your son with a
proposition, and he turned him down. Then
they parted. But Albert knew too much and
so he was lured to the woods and killed, and
Emory stood before the world as your son. It
was a devilish plot, great wealth being the object.
If you will look at the stubs in this check-book
you will see the difference in the hand-writing.”
</p>
<p>
“I rather admire your nerve, boy,” Slocum
said to Ned. “You’ve got the right kind of
courage to stand up here and tell all this to us.
You know very well that we can never let you
go out of this place alive? That even this old
man must suffer for your bit of foolish daring?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to have the training of that kid for
a few years,” Chang said. “I could beat the
world with him!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you all know what we’ve got to do,”
Emory said, angrily. “We’ve got to get rid of
the boy and this old man. If we do not, there
is an end of a rather profitable business. Besides,
with Albert Lemon dead, I become his
heir, with no possible chance of being identified
as Felix Emory.”
</p>
<p>
“You devil!” shouted the old man. “You
murderer!”
</p>
<p>
Enraged by the exclamation, Emory made
a rush for the old man, but was stopped by a
voice from the doorway opening into the rear
room.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll be all for you!” the voice said.
</p>
<p>
It was Jimmie who stood in the doorway,
smiling, and making about the worst bow a Boy
Scout ever made.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t wiggle about so, gentlemen,” he
added, “for the men behind this partition have
you all covered with repeating rifles, and some
of them are nervous. Stand still while a friend
of mine presents you with wristlets.”
</p>
<p>
Jap turned and faced the frightened group
and then pointed to the wall, near the ceiling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
where a line of two-inch holes were seen, at each
hole a shining eye.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” he said, “I cut those holes there
to-night, so the boys wouldn’t have to lie hidden
under the furniture. There’s a gun behind
every one of them. And now, with your permission—”
</p>
<p>
Jimmie passed out a bunch of clattering,
ringing handcuffs, and Jap slipped them on the
wrists of the prisoners. As he did so Frank
came dashing into the room, swinging his cap
aloft. Ernest, Jack, Pat and Liu were there,
too, overjoyed at the great victory.
</p>
<p>
“Wow!” he cried. “Here’s a wire saying
that the bunch was captured at Portland to-night,
and another from Missoula says the men
left in the caverns were caught yesterday. I
have the honor to report, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Nestor,” he added, with a low bow, “that the
round-up is complete.”
</p>
<p>
“Our day will come directly,” Emory shouted.
“You haven’t a word of proof against any
of us. Your story sounds all right here, but
wait until you get into court. Our lawyers will
pick your yarn apart like a rag doll. And you,
Jap,” he went on, turning to the servant, “when
did you turn against me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
“There have been two instances of false personation
in this case,” Ned said. “You, Emory,
personated Albert Lemon, whom you murdered,
and you, Jap, personated the servant Emory
brought here after he had seen you carried out
of the rooms for dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Then that isn’t my servant at all?” asked
Emory.
</p>
<p>
“I was in the employ of Albert Lemon,”
answered the Jap, “when you took him away
and killed him. When you came back from the
mountains you caused me to be drugged and
killed, as you supposed. But your servant hesitated
in the work. He finally turned against
you, and permitted me to come here in his stead.
It was he who disclosed the hiding place of the
duplicate key. He told me, and I told Mr. Nestor.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all a blackmailing conspiracy!” cried
Emory.
</p>
<p>
“When Mr. Nestor came back to the city,
three days ago,” the servant went on, “I was
told by the man I was personating in these
rooms that the whole plot was known. He said
that Mr. Nestor knew that you were not Albert
Lemon, also that I, Albert Lemon’s servant, still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
lived. I didn’t have much to tell him when he
came to me, but I told him all I knew.”
</p>
<p>
“And you let him search my rooms?” cried
Emory.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” was the cool reply. “He has
everything required to send you to the gallows
for the murder of Albert Lemon, and everything
necessary in the case against the smugglers and
firebugs, too. He found Emory’s servant,” he
added, facing the father, “in a Japanese tea
house, and brought him here to me after the
closing scene was set for to-night. You may
talk with him if you want to. He can tell you
how the murder of your son was planned, also
how the plot to kill Mr. Nestor in the mountains
was laid—here in these rooms.”
</p>
<p>
Again the old man sank into a chair and
buried his face in his hands. It was a severe
blow to him. He had arrived in San Francisco
that day, anticipating a pleasant month with
his son. And now to find him dead!
</p>
<p>
“It would be interesting,” said Slocum,
speaking for the first time since the arrests, “to
know just how this remarkable boy discovered
the connection between this flat and the mountain
caves.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p>
“The murder brought the clue,” Ned replied.
“From the first the clue led here. And
then the key without a stem, the smudge on
Emory’s finger, the typewritten sheets, the machine
in the mountains—oh, it was all easy
enough after the discovery that this man Emory
did not know where Albert Lemon kept his
duplicate key to that desk!
</p>
<p>
“The case is ended,” Ned continued, “and
all the parties wanted by the law are under arrest,
so, if you don’t mind, gentlemen, I’ll go
to bed!”
</p>
<p>
Jack, Pat, Ernest and Liu now advanced
into the room and looked smilingly at their
leader.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t lose us,” Jack said. “If you
don’t mind, we’ll take you back to the Rocky
Mountains for a little fun with the aeroplane.
I guess there won’t be any bold bad smugglers
up there to distract our attention for a few
weeks.”
</p>
<p>
“And then,” Jimmie cut in, “I hope you’ll
all go back to little old New York. I’m hungry
and thirsty, and sleepy for a walk down the
good old Bowery and the wise old White Way!”
</p>
<p>
The case against Felix Emory was so complete
that he pleaded guilty on being arraigned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
in court and was sentenced to the gallows.
Chang received a long sentence for his connection
with the murder, and the smugglers and
firebugs were sent to prison for ten years each.
</p>
<p>
The clean-up was so complete that Ned was
requested to visit Washington and confer with
the Secret Service chief regarding other cases.
</p>
<p>
“But, after all,” he said, on leaving Jimmie
and the other boys, including Ernest and Liu,
in New York, “I don’t think I want any more
fighting forest fires assignments in the Secret
Service. We’ll go back some day and look over
the ground, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able
to get some of those rides in the air out of my
mind.”

By OWEN JONES and MARCUS WOODMAN
</p>
<p>
With a Message to Boy Scouts by SIR BADEN-POWELL,
Founder of the Boy Scouts’ Movement.
</p>
<p>
One of the essential requirements of the Boy
Scout training is a Knowledge of Woodcraft.
This necessitates a book embracing
all the subjects and treating on all the topics that
a thorough knowledge of Woodcraft implies.
</p>
<p>
This book thoroughly exhausts the subject. It imparts
a comprehensive knowledge of woods from fungus
growth to the most stately monarch of the forest;
it treats of the habits and lairs of all the feathered and
furry inhabitants of the woods. Shows how to trail
wild animals; how to identify birds and beasts by
their tracks, calls, etc. Tells how to forecast the
weather, and in fact treats on every phase of nature
with which a Boy Scout or any woodman or lover of
nature should be familiar. The authorship guarantees
its authenticity and reliability. Indispensable to “Boy
Scouts” and others. Printed from large clear type on
superior paper.

Illustrations Taken From Life.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
